<p class="center b20 p4">THE STORY OF THE MERCHANT
MARINE</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="s08">IN THE BEGINNING</span>

</h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_1">[1]</a></span><span class="b20">T</span>HE first vessel built within the limits of the
United States for commercial uses was a sea-going
pinnace of thirty tons named the <i>Virginia</i>.
Her keel was laid at the mouth of the Kennebec
River, in Maine, on an unnamed day in the fall of 1607.
The story of this vessel, though brief, is of great interest
because, in part, of certain peculiarities of rig and hull
which, in connection with a sea-going vessel, now seem
astounding, but chiefly because it portrays something of
the character of the men who, a little later, laid the
foundations of the American Republic.
</p>
<p>The adventure which led to the building of the <i>Virginia</i>
grew out of that wonderful harvest of the sea, the cod
fishery on the banks of Newfoundland. For more than a
hundred years before she was built many fishermen of
Europe had been sailing to the Banks in early spring and
returning home each fall. Throughout the sixteenth
century there were from 100 to 300 fishing vessels there

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
every year, excepting only those years when wars raged
the hardest. In 1577, for instance, as the records show,
350 vessels sailed for the Banks, gathered their harvest,
went ashore in the bay where St. John, Newfoundland,
now stands, cured the catch on flakes built on the beach,
and then sailed for home well satisfied.
</p>
<p>Though dimly seen now, those fishermen, as they flocked
across the sea in the spring, form one of the most striking
pictures in history. For no one had ever charted the western
limits of that waste of waters. The Banks lay beyond
a belt of the sea famous, or infamous, as the "roaring forties."
And yet in ships so rude that the hulls were sometimes
bound with hawsers to hold them together these men
anchored where black fogs shut them in, where sleet-laden
gales were a part of their common life, where bergs
and fields of ice assaulted them, and where irresistible
hurricanes from the unknown wilds beyond came to overwhelm
them. To these real dangers they added others
that, though born of the imagination, were still more
terrifying. They saw evil spirits in the storm clouds, and
demons came shrieking in the gales to carry their souls
to eternal torment.
</p>
<p>Even in pleasant weather life was hard. Masters ruled
their crews by torture. To punish an obstinate sailor
they wrapped a stout cord around his forehead and then
set it taut until his eyes were popped from the sockets.
The food brought from home spoiled. In the best vessels
the crew slept in leaking, unwarmed forecastles, while

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
in some of the vessels&mdash;those that were but partly decked
over&mdash;they slept unsheltered. The brine of the sea
covered them with sores called sea boils, and their hands
dripped blood as they hauled in their cod lines.
</p>
<p>Consider further that these fishermen came from four
nations that were always at war with each other, either
openly or in an underhanded way. And yet the English,
the French, the Spanish, and the Portuguese anchored side
by side on the Banks, built their flakes side by side on the
Newfoundland beach, and when a ship opened her seams
as she wallowed in the gale, the crews of the others within
reach eagerly lowered their boats to rescue the drowning.
</p>
<p>In courage, fortitude, sea skill, and resourcefulness those
Banks fishermen had never been surpassed.
</p>
<p>This is by no means to say that the fishermen never
fought each other. Good fair fighting was a part of the comfort
of life as they saw it. But the conditions that eliminated
the weaklings naturally created in their minds a standard
of justice under which all who survived could work.
</p>
<p>Let it be noted now that with all their hardships they
were not without compensating rewards. Good digestion
waited on appetite. The life ashore while curing the catch&mdash;a
life where venison and wild fowl replaced their salted
meats, and the red people of the region came to visit
them&mdash;was a time for jollification. But more important
than all else they had leisure as well as hard work. For
having a share in the catch instead of wages, they obtained
enough money, on reaching home, to enable them to pass

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
the winter beside the hearthstone, where they told tales
of adventures that stirred the blood. So the love of the
sea was cultivated and the race was perpetuated.
</p>
<p>Into the midst of these fishermen, as they worked among
their flakes upon the Newfoundland beach, came Sir Humphrey
Gilbert, on August 5, 1583, who was the forerunner
of the New England colonists. He told them he had come
to take possession of the country and establish an English
colony there. The fishermen saw that such a settlement
would interfere with their business, but no resistance was
made while he erected a monument and did such other
things as the customs of the day required of those taking
possession of a new land. One may fancy they saw in
Sir Humphrey a man of their own sort. For he had
crossed the sea in the ten-ton <i>Squirrel</i>, and although she
was, as they said, "too small a bark to pass through the
ocean sea at that season of the year," he sailed in her
when bound for home; he would not ask his men to take
a risk which he would not share. And when the storm
that overwhelmed him came, he sat down at the stern of
the little bark with a book in his hand, and shouted in a
cheerful voice to the crew of the <i>Hind</i>, which was close
alongside:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"We are as near to heaven by sea as by land."
</p>
<p>The sailors of Gilbert's expedition have been called
"no better than pirates" (Bancroft), but at worst they were
able to cherish the abiding faith of their master as expressed
in those words. The seamen who sailed (1530)

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
with William Hawkins in that "tall and goodlie ship of
his own," the <i>Paul</i>, to the coasts of Africa and Brazil, and
with Drake in the <i>Pelican</i> in that famous voyage around
the world, and with Raleigh's expedition to the coast of
North Carolina, were recruited from among these fishermen,
to whom adventure was as the breath of life. And
the men who did the actual work of building the <i>Virginia</i>
were of the same class.
</p>
<p>As the reader remembers, the first charter of Virginia
as a colony provided for two colony-planting companies.
One, the London Company, settled its colonists in what is
now the State of Virginia, while the other, the West-of-England
or Plymouth Company, was to people the northern
coast. In May, 1607, the Plymouth Company sent two
vessels to establish a fishing colony on what is now the
coast of Maine. One of the vessels was a "fly-boat"
called the <i>Gift of God</i>. A fly-boat was a flat-bottomed,
shoal-draft vessel handy for exploring inland waters.
The other was "a good ship" named the <i>Mary and John</i>.
These ships shaped their course to an island off the coast
then well known to the fishermen, and now called Monhegan,
"a round high Ile," where they arrived on August
9. On the 18th they located their settlement on a
peninsula, on the west side of the mouth of the Kennebec,
which was "almost an island." There they erected
dwellings, a storehouse, and a church, with a fort enclosing
all. Then "the carpenters framed a pretty pinnace
of about 30 tons, which they called the <i>Virginia</i>, the chief

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
shipwright being one Digby of London." A plan of the
fort as "taken by John Hunt, the VIII day of October in
the yeere of our Lorde 1607," is reproduced in Brown's
<i>Genesis of the United States</i>. This chart is important
because it shows under the guns of the fort a small vessel
which was, no doubt, the "pretty pinnace" <i>Virginia</i>.
</p>
<p>While the dimensions of the <i>Virginia</i> were not recorded,
we can get a fair idea of her size from Charnock's <i>History
of Marine Architecture</i> (II, 431), where a smack named
the <i>Escape Royal</i>, in 1660, was of 34 tons burden and 30
feet 6 inches long by 14 feet 3 inches wide, and 7 feet 9
inches deep. The 30-ton <i>Virginia</i> was not far from these
dimensions. She carried a spritsail and a jib. As the
sail spread was insufficient for driving the vessel in light
airs and confined waters, oars were provided. The hull
was partly decked, enough to protect the cargo.
</p>
<p>The crew had to be content with an awning when the
wind was light. When the wind was heavy, they had to
face the gale, as was the custom on the Banks. And yet
the <i>Virginia</i> was built by men who intended to use her
not only in the fishery and the coasting trade with the
Indians, but for oversea trade as well. It is a matter of
record, too, that she made at least one voyage from England
to the Chesapeake, and it is believed that some of the
Kennebec colonists sailed in her upon that voyage.
</p>
<p>Curiously enough, however, the Kennebec colony failed
somewhat ingloriously. The winter was long and severe.
A fire destroyed the storehouse and the provisions that

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
had been brought from England. The unexplored wilderness
oppressed them. In fact, while they would face a
hurricane at sea in an open boat, the terrors of the wilderness,
though chiefly of their own imagining, drove them
away, and they were hard pressed at home to find excuses
for what they had done.
</p>
<p>In the meantime a settlement was made at Jamestown,
Virginia. Of the 105 colonists at Jamestown, 48 were
described as gentlemen, 12 as laborers, 4 as carpenters,
and the others as servants and soldiers. The servants
were white slaves, who were not, however, held for life.
The ships with this oddly assorted colony arrived in the
Chesapeake on April 20, 1607. Of the things done at
Jamestown two only need be considered here. They
began creating a merchant marine in 1611 by building a
shallop of twelve or thirteen tons' burden. A Spaniard
who visited the colony at that time noted that the iron
used in the boat had been taken from a wreck at Bermuda&mdash;a
fact that shows the colonists had not had enough interest
in ship-building to bring iron for that purpose from
home.
</p>
<p>The truth is the Virginia colonists never had much interest
in shipping, save only as they built many vessels of
small size for use in local transportation on their inland
waters. The reason for this condition of affairs is pointed
out in Bruce's <i>Economic History of Virginia</i>. The
money crop was, as it is now, in many parts of the State,
tobacco. Tobacco had been introduced into England in

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
1586. The settlers found the Indians cultivating it on
the James River, but they gave little heed to it until 1612,
when John Rolfe, the first American "squaw man," began
producing it partly for his own use and partly because he
was trying to find some product that could be exported to
England with profit. Thus Rolfe's garden was the first
American agricultural experiment station. Under cultivation
the leaf produced was of better quality than that
obtained from the Indians, and when a trial shipment was
sent to England the success of the venture was great.
Thereupon the colonists became so eager to produce it
that the authorities felt obliged to prohibit the crop unless
at least two acres of grain were grown at the same time
by each planter.
</p>
<p>The demand for Virginia tobacco increased until the
merchants sent their agents to the colony to buy and pay
for the crop long before it was harvested; they even sent
ships to lie there for months before the harvest in order to
have first chance to secure it. Why should the Virginians
build or buy ships under such circumstances?
</p>
<p>Now consider some of the conditions surrounding the
first New England settlers. Many fishermen had visited
the New England coast before a settlement was made
there. These adventurers found full fares and they
looked upon the coast at a season when it was not "stern."
</p>
<p>It was to this coast that the Pilgrims came.
</p>
<p>Of the well-known story of the Pilgrims it seems necessary
to recall here, first of all, the fact that they were Englishmen

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
who had lived for several years among the Dutch,
a people who described themselves upon their coinage as
a nation whose "way is on the sea." More than a thousand
ships were built every year in Holland where the
Pilgrims were sojourning, and everybody lived in a seafaring
atmosphere. Though a distinct people, the Pilgrims
necessarily absorbed, as one may say, something of the
Dutch aptitude for trade and sea life. Thus, when ready
to migrate to America, they were able to secure the capital
they needed for the venture from merchants who were
acquainted with the success that had attended the fishing
voyages to the coast.
</p>
<p>It is worth noting, too, that Captain Thomas Jones, of
the <i>Mayflower</i>, had fished in Greenland waters, and that
Mate Robert Coppin was carried as the pilot of the ship
because he had been on the parts of the coast to which the
expedition was bound. The Pilgrims intended to settle
somewhere near the Hudson River, but on November 11,
1620, the <i>Mayflower</i> was found at anchor under Cape Cod.
While lying there a number of the company came to think
that a settlement there would serve their purpose well,
and the reasons given in support of this proposition are
of interest because they show what business ideas animated
these Pilgrims. The location, they said, "afforded
a good harbor for boats." It was "a place of profitable
fishing." "The master and his mate and others experienced
in fishing" preferred it to the Greenland fishery
where whaling made large profits. Moreover, the situation

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
was "healthy, secure and defensible." While the
desire for "freedom to worship God" was perhaps uppermost
in their talk, as it was in their writings, the Pilgrims
were "intensely practical in applying their theories of
Providence and Divine control to the immediate business
in hand," as Weeden says, in his <i>Economic History of
New England</i>.
</p>
<p>After settling at Plymouth, as the reader remembers,
life was hard during the first years. But the poetic rhapsodies
about the "stern and rock-bound coast" do not
convey an accurate idea of the agricultural possibilities
of the region. Some of the farm lands of eastern Massachusetts
are among the most prolific and profitable in the
nation. The average yield of Indian corn per acre in
Massachusetts in 1907 (see Year Book, Department of
Agriculture) was exceeded only by that of Maine (another
part of the "stern and rock-bound coast") and that of
the irrigated lands of Arizona. Arizona averaged 37.5
bushels per acre, Maine 37, and Massachusetts 36. Consider,
too, that it was in April, "while the birds sang in
the woods most pleasantly," that Squanto and Hobomoc,
red neighbors, taught these Englishmen how to fertilize
the fields with fish, and to plant corn in fields that the
Indians had cleared. And corn, produced on these fields,
formed the first cargo of the first American sea-trader of
which we have a definite record.
</p>
<p>Through various causes not necessary to enumerate
the Pilgrims got on so poorly that it was not until 1624

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
that they began ship-building. The prosperity that came
to them in that year was due to success in fishing. They
took enough cod to freight a ship for England. The
profit on the cod was so much beyond the immediate need
of the people that they launched "two very good and
strong shallops (which after did them greate service)."
</p>
<p>As it happened, in the year following the building of
these shallops the Pilgrims produced such an abundant
crop of corn that they had some to sell. Accordingly they
loaded a shallop with it, and sent it, under Winslow, to the
Kennebec, where he traded it for 700 pounds of beaver
skins.
</p>
<p>A year later a more important, or at any rate a more
profitable, voyage was made. Some English merchants
who had maintained a trading-post on Monhegan Island
sent word down the beach that they were going to abandon
it and would sell the remainder of their goods at a bargain.
Although in the years that had passed the Pilgrims had,
at times, come so near to starvation that men had been
seen to stagger in the street because they were faint with
hunger, they had persisted. They had caught and sold
fish. They had produced forest products and corn for sale.
They had traded with the Indians for furs. They had
traded with the fishermen who came over from England,
and they had made a profit on every deal&mdash;they had not
lived in Holland for nothing. When a bargain in trade
goods on Monhegan Island was offered, they had capital
to make a purchase, and going there with a shallop they

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
secured stuff worth £400. Then, on finding at the mouth
of the Kennebec some other goods that had been taken
from a French ship wrecked on that coast, they bought an
additional £100 worth, which was all their boat would
hold, as one may suppose. For as soon as they reached
Plymouth Bay they cut their shallop in two and lengthened
her, so that when another opportunity was offered
to buy goods at a bargain she would have a larger capacity.
</p>
<p>Recall, now, a number of events occurring in America
before, and at about the time of, the first voyages of the
Pilgrim shallops. Henry Hudson had sailed in the <i>Half
Moon</i> up the river that bears his name (September, 1609),
and the Dutch, after building a few fur-buying posts in
that country, had begun a permanent settlement on the
lower end of Manhattan Island (1623). Adrien Block, a
Dutch explorer, had built a "yacht" on Manhattan Island
(during the winter of 1614-1615), that was used later
in the coasting trade. At New Amsterdam the Dutch
built many small boats for gathering furs on the Hudson,
and they repaired ships coming to the port when there
was need. But as late as October 10, 1658, J. Aldrichs
wrote a letter from that town saying, in connection with a
"galliot" that was needed for local use (N. Y. C. docs. II,
51):&mdash;
</p>
<p>"We are not yet in condition to build such a craft here."
</p>
<p>At a still earlier date the French had made a permanent
settlement in Canada. In the long story of the French
in America it is of interest to note first that the Bretons and

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Basques had been among the pioneers on the Newfoundland
fishing banks. It is not difficult to believe that
the Basques were there before Cabot's time.
</p>
<p>Of the French explorers we need to recall but one,
Samuel de Champlain, "young, ardent, yet ripe in experience,
a skilled seaman and a practiced soldier," who had
been leading a strenuous life in the West Indies. In 1603
he made a voyage to the St. Lawrence River. In 1604
he helped to make a settlement on the St. Croix River,
where he remained until the next year. When a badly
needed relief ship came in 1605, he explored the New England
coast down around Cape Cod.
</p>
<p>In 1608 Champlain built a trading-post where Quebec
now stands, and in 1616 there were two real home-builders
there, a farmer named Louis Hebert and Champlain
himself. In 1626 the population numbered 105, all told.
It is not unlikely that the French ship, from which the
Pilgrims obtained enough cheap goods to fill their shallop,
in their second voyage to the Maine coast, had been
wrecked while on a voyage to Quebec. The seafaring
merchants of New England inevitably took much interest
in the development of this colony from a rival nation.
</p>
<p>Still more interesting, though in a different way, were
the settlements of the West Indies. The Spaniards had
introduced the sugar-cane and negro slavery, an economic
combination of the greatest importance to the commerce
of the world; for while the Spaniards maintained, as far
as possible, a monopoly of their own trade, both slavery

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and sugar-planting spread all over the islands. Moreover,
Spanish exclusiveness was to lead to adventures on the
part of some New Englanders.
</p>
<p>In 1605 the crew of an English ship took possession of
Barbados. On February 17, 1625, an English ship "landed
forty English and seven or eight negroes" on the island,
and thus began building a colony that was of the utmost
importance to New England traders in later years. In
1676 the export of sugar "was capable of employing 400
sail of vessels, averaging 150 tons."
</p>
<p>In the meantime (1619), a Dutch privateer had come
to Jamestown, Virginia, where "twenty Africans were
disembarked," and sold to planters who were to use negro
slaves, for many years thereafter, with profit, in the production
of tobacco. And slaves, sugar, and tobacco were
among the first articles of merchandise to bring profit to
the New England ship-owners.
</p>
<p>Most interesting of all, however, were the centres of
population established upon the New England coast. The
English fishermen who came to the coast after the arrival
of the Pilgrims, occasionally landed men to remain through
the winter in order to trade for furs and procure a supply
of provisions&mdash;venison, wild fowl, etc.&mdash;for the use
of the crews of the ships that were to return in the spring.
</p>
<p>Of this character was a settlement made at Cape Ann in
1623. The Rev. John White, of Dorchester, England,
having become interested in the fishermen, persuaded
some merchants to send out people to form a colony. The

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
whole business was badly managed; in 1626 the merchants
abandoned the colony, and most of the people returned
to England. But one Roger Conant and "a few of the
most honest <i>and industrious</i> resolved to stay." They
removed, however, to a point on the coast known as
Naumkeag, where they made a settlement which they
named Salem.
</p>
<p>In the meantime White had been working faithfully in
England to promote the interests of these men, and in
1628 sixty or seventy emigrants were sent over to join
them. In 1629 White and other English Puritans procured
a charter for "a colony under the title of The
Governor and Company of Massachusetts Bay." The
settlers who came to America and lived under this charter
were the "Puritans" of American history, a fact that
seems worth especial mention because a modern mark of
intelligence in New England is found in the ability to
distinguish between the "Pilgrims" who formed the colony
on Plymouth Bay, or the "Old Colony," and the
"Puritans" who made the settlements at the head of
Massachusetts Bay.
</p>
<p>The colonists who came over in 1628 explored the head
of the bay, and some of them located where Charlestown
now stands. With its dancing waters, its green islands,
and its views of the distant blue hills from which the Indians
had already called it Massachusetts, the region was
enchanting, and the Puritan explorers described it in such
glowing colors that 200 more settlers were brought over

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the next year. The Puritans were the original "boomers"
of America.
</p>
<p>Among the 200 who arrived in 1629 there were wheelwrights,
carpenters, and ship-builders. The ship-builders
went up the Mystic River to the place where Medford
now stands, and established a shipyard. A considerable
number of the emigrants of 1630 joined them. This was
the first American shipyard, properly so called.
</p>
<p>It is also to be noted that some of these emigrants,
under the lead of John Winthrop, located on the peninsula
opposite Charlestown, which was distinguished by
a three-pointed hill and a "Backbay," where they built a
town named Boston.
</p>
<p>The French, having a water-road to the far-away regions
of the Great Lakes, became wholly absorbed in
the fur trade. The Dutch on the Hudson, though less
favorably situated, had a western outlet through the
Iroquois Indian country, and did a large business in furs.
The English on Barbados, having a favorable climate,
a fertile soil, and slaves, were preparing to supply all
Englishmen with sugar, while the English on the Chesapeake,
having facilities similar to those at Barbados, were
already astonishing the commercial world with their
product of tobacco.
</p>
<p>The New Englanders had no considerable back country
from which they could draw furs; they had no water
route to the interior, and at that time they were unable
to produce any crop from the soil for which a good market

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
could be found in Europe. But what they lacked in these
respects they made up by hard work in the development
of such resources as their country afforded. The histories
of New England are full of tales of privation and suffering
endured during the first years of their existence, and the
stories are all true. But as soon as those settlers had
learned how to supplement their prayers for daily bread
by well-directed efforts to secure it, hunger fled. They
then saw that the waters laving their feet were inviting
them to go afloat to seek fortune in the uttermost parts
of the earth, and they accepted the invitation.
</p>
<p>On July 4, 1631 (the fact that it was on July 4 has
attracted the attention of more than one New Englander
as a "beautiful coincidence"), the ship-builders on the
Mystic launched their first sea-going vessel. "The bark,
being of thirty tons," was named the <i>Blessing of the Bay</i>.
Her owner, Governor John Winthrop, recorded his
reason for building her:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"The general fear of want of foreign commodities, now
that our money was gone, set us on work to provide shipping
of our own."
</p>
<p>That statement was characteristic of the people as well
as of Winthrop. A "want"&mdash;any want&mdash;"set them
on work" to provide for themselves.
</p>
<p>The <i>Blessing of the Bay</i> was not a "bark" according
to modern nomenclature. She was a vessel of one mast,
and much like the vessel built by the less persistent people
in the earlier settlement at the mouth of the Kennebec.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
On August 31 she "went on a voyage to eastward," to
trade with the Indians, beyond a doubt, and to pick up
such business as might be offered by the few settlers and
the fishermen to be found along shore. The fishing and
trading station which "fishmongers in London" had
built on the Piscataqua, at which no planting was done,
was probably the most important point visited.
</p>
<p>Another incident of this year, 1631, is of almost as much
interest as the launch of the <i>Blessing of the Bay</i>. One
John Winter established a shipyard on Richmond Island,
off Cape Elizabeth (near the site of the modern Portland),
Maine. Some time in December Winter began to build
there a ship for merchants in Plymouth, England. As
already noted, other ships had been built in America by
Europeans for European use, but Winter's work may be
called the beginning of the American business of building
ships for export.
</p>
<p>Three facts about Winter's shipyard may be correlated.
In 1638 sixty men were at work in it. During the year a
300-ton ship brought a cargo of wines and liquors to the
island. "It was a sporadic" settlement, and it "dwindled
away."
</p>
<p>Winthrop's <i>Blessing of the Bay</i> appears to have been the
first New England vessel to open trade with the Dutch
on Manhattan Island. She went there in 1633, perhaps
sooner. In 1627 the Dutch had invited "friendly commercial
relations" with the Pilgrims by sending the governor
of the colony "a rundlet of sugar and two Holland

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Cheeses," with a letter in which they offered to "accommodate"&mdash;to
give credit. But the Pilgrims were shy because
the Dutch had been trading with the Connecticut
Indians, a region claimed by the English; the Dutch had
come even to the head of Buzzard's Bay, where the Pilgrims
were maintaining a post for the fur trade. However,
in September, 1627, the Dutch sent Isaac de Rasieres
with a small trial cargo in the "barque Nassau" to see
what he could do, and he proved a worthy forerunner of
the great race of American commercial travellers. For
he carried soldiers and trumpeters along, not to fight, but
to do honor to the occasion by means of salutes and blaring
music; and he chose these men from among the residents
of New Amsterdam who had known some of the
Pilgrims in Holland. Indeed, some of them were related
to the Pilgrims. Naturally, after "the joyful meeting of
kindred as well as friends," and after much fine talk and
the display of goods,&mdash;especially of "wampum,"&mdash;De
Rasieres made what he called "the beginning of a profitable
trade."
</p>
<p>Wampum (bits of sea-shell) was the coin of the red men.
The chief mint of the continent was on Long Island. All
red men, at that time, were much more anxious to get
wampum than the silver coin of the white man. The
Pilgrims were glad to buy the wampum because the
Indians of New England had but little, and were eager
to get it.
</p>
<p>It was no doubt to secure a supply of wampum and

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
such West India products as sugar and salt, in which the
Dutch traded, that Winthrop sent his <i>Blessing of the Bay</i>
to Manhattan Island.
</p>
<p>Certain details of the earlier voyages should now prove
interesting. For instance, Winthrop's vessel was at first
engaged in trading on her owner's account. She was not
a freighter, looking for cargo to carry at a price per ton,
but a floating store, so to say, carrying merchandise for
sale or exchange. The distinction between the freighter and
the ship trading on owners' account is to be kept in mind.
</p>
<p>After the New Englanders had spread to Connecticut
there is a record of the employment of the <i>Blessing of the
Bay</i> as a freighter. She carried goods from Massachusetts
Bay to Connecticut at 30<i>s.</i> per ton.
</p>
<p>In 1629 the freight rate between England and Massachusetts
Bay was £3 per ton. Passengers were carried at
£5 each, and horses at £10 each. The goods rate increased
after a time.
</p>
<p>That the oversea rates were remunerative is manifest from
the increase in the number of ships finding employment in
the trade. In 1635 the Secretary to the Admiralty learned
that forty ships were regularly employed in the trade, of
which "six sail of ships, at least" belonged to the Americans.
</p>
<p>The profits in the trade on owners' account were also
recorded. In 1636 Thomas Mayhew and John Winthrop,
Jr., as partners, sent a vessel to the Bermudas, then called
the Summer Islands, where she sold corn and pork and
bought oranges, lemons, and potatoes. Perhaps that

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
was the first importation of Bermuda potatoes. The
profit on the venture was "twenty od pounds."
</p>
<p>The <i>Richmond</i>, a 30-ton vessel, built by Winter at Richmond
Island, Maine, carried 6000 pipe-staves from the
island to England, where they were sold at a profit of a
little over £25 per thousand.
</p>
<p>An idea of the profits on some of the voyages "eastward"
to trade with the Indians can be had from the records of
the Pilgrims, who, with their shallops, became experts in
that line. Between 1631 and 1636, inclusive, the Pilgrims
bought and shipped 12,150 pounds of beaver skins
and 1156 of otter. "Ye parcells of beaver came to little
less than 10,000 li. [pounds]. And ye otter skins would
pay all ye charges," as Governor Bradford wrote. As
otter skins sold for from 14 to 15<i>s.</i> a pound, "ye charges"
in a business that gave a profit of "little less than £10,000"
did not exceed £867. And this profit was made, although
the Pilgrims had to buy some of their trade goods on
credit and pay 40 per cent interest per annum on the sum
thus borrowed.
</p>
<p>It was at this period of the history of the American
merchant marine that Captain Thomas Wiggin, an observing
shipmaster from Bristol, England, wrote a letter
about the New Englanders, in which he said:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"The English, numbering about two thousand, <i>and
generally most industrious</i>, have done more in three years
than others in seven times that space, and at a tenth of
the expense."
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER II
<br />
<span class="s08">EARLY GROWTH</span>
</h2>
<p><span class="b20">A</span>LTHOUGH geographical conditions were in most
respects against them, it is manifest from any
study of the New Englanders that their chief
mercantile interests, during the earliest years, were concentrated
in the fur trade. The Pilgrims devoted their
first surplus crop to that trade, and the first voyage of
Winthrop's <i>Blessing of the Bay</i> was to "eastward." According
to the contracts, they had come to make fishing
stations; yet the large profits made on such furs as they
were able to secure kept their minds fixed on the Indian
trade. But, happily, at an opportune moment a man
came to Salem who was able to see that enduring prosperity
could be found by the colonists only in the fisheries;
and by example as well as precept he speedily led them to
accept his view. Curiously enough, as it must seem in
our modern view of the profession, this man was a clergyman,
the Rev. Hugh Peter (written also Peters).
</p>
<p>Few more stirring stories are to be found in the history
of New England than the biography of Hugh Peter. He
was born in England, of wealthy parents, in 1599, graduated

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
at Cambridge in 1622, and immediately took holy
orders. Very soon, however, he had (or made) such
trouble with the church authorities that he had to flee from
the country. Then he served an English congregation in
Rotterdam until 1634, when he came to New England
and was made pastor of the Puritans at Salem.
</p>
<p>In 1641 Peter was sent as ambassador to treat with the
Dutch of New Amsterdam for a settlement of the disputes
over the territory of Connecticut, and the records of his
work, especially the proposals which he submitted (N. Y. C.
docs. I, 567), show that he was a master of diplomacy.
His work with the Dutch led the colonists to send him as
their ambassador to England, when the civil war began
there. Being a Puritan, he naturally joined the hosts of
Cromwell and with such energy and zeal as were characteristic
of the man.
</p>
<p>In June, 1645, he was made "Chaplain of the Train,"
and a little later private secretary to Cromwell. He was
with his chief at the storming of the castle at Winchester
and when the dour hosts swept over the works at Basing.
As a special honor, and because of his eloquence, Cromwell
sent him on each occasion to tell Parliament how the
battles were won; and the reader who would like to learn
what a preacher had to say about such fighting as was
done in those battles can find one of the addresses in
Carlyle's <i>Cromwell</i>. Having been sent on a mission to
Holland, he delivered a sermon which stirred the audience
until "crowds of women" stripped the wedding rings from

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
their fingers to aid in providing funds for the work of the
great Commoner.
</p>
<p>For his zeal he was arrested soon after the Restoration.
"His trial was a scene of flagrant injustice," and he was
condemned, hanged, and quartered. But he faced his
accusers and death as he had faced all else in life. He was
placed on the gallows while one of his friends was yet hanging
there, and was compelled to look on while the corpse
was lowered and cut to pieces. When this had been done,
one of the executioners turned, and rubbing his bloody
hands together, said to Peter:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"How like you this?"
</p>
<p>But Peter, in a voice of unconcern, replied&mdash;
</p>
<p>"I thank God I am not terrified at it; you may do
your worst."
</p>
<p>When Hugh Peter came to Salem, he found the people
of the colony, with few exceptions, living in log houses
that had thatched roofs and dirt floors. They were frontiersmen,
a thin line of population stretched along the
beach. Although there were masters and servants, there
was less division of labor than that fact would now seem
to imply. Owners and servants worked together. They
cut timber in the forest for lumber and fuel; they built
houses of all needed kinds; they cultivated the soil and
they cared for their cattle. The New World was almost
without form and void, but the divine power of labor was
moving upon the wastes. A natural-born leader was
needed, however, and Hugh Peter was the man for the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
hour. He saw that the fur trade was slipping away and
that some other resource must be provided. Better yet,
he saw that the fisheries would provide a permanent prosperity,
and he began to preach the gospel of good fish
markets in far countries. No record of his arguments
remains, but we may easily learn what he said by reading
the contemporary writings of John Smith, who used the
facts vigorously, as Peter did beyond a doubt.
</p>
<p>In 1619 "there went" to America, said Smith, a ship
"of 200 tuns ... which with eight and thirty men and
boys had her freight, which she sold for £2100 ... so
that every poor sailor that had but a single share had his
charges and sixteen pounds ten shillings for his seven
months work." In 1620 three different ships "made so
good a voyage that every sailor that had a single share had
twenty pounds for his seven months work, which is more
than in twenty months he should have gotten had he gone
for wages anywhere."
</p>
<p>If a statement of the gains of a foremast hand would
serve as an effective argument in England, it would be
much more effective in New England, where many men
low in the social scale were finding opportunities to rise&mdash;where,
indeed, men who had come over as indentured
servants had already become capitalists able to join in a
venture afloat. The profits of the merchants were also
known and printed, however, even though not considered
a matter of first importance by Smith. Thus there was
a statement that "the charge of setting forth a ship of 100

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
tuns with 40 persons to make a fishing voyage" was £420
11<i>s.</i> The average take of fish on the American coast would
sell for £2100, of which £700 would be the share of the
merchant supplying the outfit costing £420 11<i>s.</i> His
profit on the voyage would therefore be near 100 per cent,
even though the prevailing rate of interest on borrowed
money were 40 per cent. The ship-owner took
a third of the income from the voyage, and made a still
larger profit, for a hundred-ton ship could be built in
New England, as Randolph noted, for £4 per ton.
</p>
<p>With these facts in hand Hugh Peter went among his
people preaching the gospel of enterprise with as much enthusiasm
no doubt as he felt and displayed later in preaching
religious doctrines before Cromwell's men. As a
result of his work he "procured a good sum of money to
be raised to set on foot the fishing business, and wrote into
England to raise as much more." Further than that, the
General Court, as the governing body of the colony was
called, appointed six men to fish "for general account."
</p>
<p>The Salem people made money from the first. The
business spread to near-by Marblehead, and the people
there became so much interested that when a minister in
the pulpit told them that they ought to seek the "kingdom
of heaven to the <i>exclusion</i> of all earthly blessings,"
one of the congregation interrupted him by saying, "You
think you are preaching to the people at the Bay. Our
<i>main</i> end is to catch fish."
</p>
<p>By 1640 the Salem people had made such progress and

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
profits in their fishery that they were able to launch a ship
of 300 tons, a monster of a vessel for the day and place.
Moreover, Boston people were so wrought up by Peter's
enterprise in this matter that they also built a ship at the
same time, the <i>Trial</i>, of 160 (or 200) tons.
</p>
<p>Unhappily for Salem, her people had no leader after
Peter sailed for England, and Boston soon gained the
ascendancy in commerce as in politics. But for many years
Salem was a port of vast importance in the story of our
merchant marine.
</p>
<p>In the meantime (1636), the <i>Desire</i>, a ship of 120 tons,
was built at Marblehead for the fishing business. It is
likely that Peter inspired the people there to build her.
She was engaged in fishing for two years and then made
a voyage in the slave trade, and thus acquired enduring
notoriety.
</p>
<p>Of much more importance than these large vessels in
promoting the shipping interests of the colonists were
the small vessels, smacks, and shallops, which men of
limited means built and used. A seven-ton shallop could
be built for £25, and in the hands of her owners she was
well able to go fishing. Friends and neighbors united
their labor as well as their accumulations of capital in
sending the small boats to sea. Even the dugout canoe
which a man could make for himself was used in the bay
fisheries, and the whole world was within the reach and
grasp of a man who had the courage and enterprise to
launch forth in a dugout canoe of his own making. It

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
was in and through such men that the American colonists
<i>were gaining the sea habit</i>.
</p>
<p>The cod was the fish of chief importance, though other
varieties were sent abroad, and used at home in enormous
quantities. Mackerel, though some were eaten and some
exported, were used chiefly for bait. Sturgeon eggs were
made into caviare then, as now, while the flesh of the sturgeon
was smoked and sold&mdash;perhaps as the flesh of some
more delicate fish. Hake, halibut, and haddock were of
some importance, but the one fish that ranked next after
the cod was the alewife.
</p>
<p>It is said that alewives were so called because their
well-rounded abdomens reminded the fishermen of such
of their wives as were too fond of malt drinks! Millions
of alewives came to the coast and swarmed up the streams
until the channels seemed to be filled solid with the struggling
bodies. Seines, scoop-nets, and even the naked
hands were used in taking them, but the weir was in common
use from the first. Indeed, the Indians used weirs
before the white men came.
</p>
<p>The people naturally looked upon these swarming fish
as common property, and when weirs were built by private
enterprise and the owners were thus able to "control the
market" to a certain extent, laws were promptly enacted
to regulate these primitive "trusts." One John Clark
was allowed to build a weir at Cambridge on condition
that he sell to no one not an inhabitant of the town "except
for bait." The interests of the commonwealth were placed

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
ahead of those of the small community when there was a
need of "bait." The price of alewives was fixed at "IIIs
6d per thousand." Another monopolist was to "fetch
home the alewives from the weir; and he is to have XVId
a thousand and load them himself for carriage; and <i>to
have the power to take any man to help him</i>, he paying of
him for his work."
</p>
<p>The importance of alewives to the people is thus shown
clearly. The notable uses of alewives were as food, as
fertilizers, and as bait, but a few were smoked for export.
</p>
<p>The early laws governing the fisheries may well have
still further consideration here. After Hugh Peter began
arousing an interest in the fisheries, the General Court
exempted fishing vessels from all charges for a period of
seven years, beginning in 1639. Fishermen and ship
carpenters were excused from serving the public on
training days. When alewives were taken at the weirs,
the fishermen were to be served at statute-made prices
before any were to be offered to the public. This was
provided for, of course, after the farmers had learned
their art well enough to prevent the fear of starvation.
Land was set aside for fish-curing stages, and pasture
was provided for the cattle which fishermen owned but
could not attend to while at sea.
</p>
<p>Until 1648 the fishermen, on coming ashore to "make"
their catch, were allowed to land, cut timber, and erect
their stages for the work regardless of the ownership of the
ground where they landed. After that date they were

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
still allowed to do the same things, but they were then
required to pay the owner of the land for the use of land
and timber. In 1652, to preserve the reputation of the
colony product of fish, the law provided for "fish viewers"
at "every fishing place," whose duty it was to separate
cured fish into grades according to quality.
</p>
<p>Some details of the early methods of taking fish on the
Banks were recorded. Neither the dory nor the trawl
had then been developed. Hand-lines thrown from the
deck of the fishing ship were used exclusively. The
hooks and lines were imported from England, and Smith
records the price: "12 dozen of fishing lines, £6; 24
dozen of fishing hooks, £2." The Indians made fairly
good hooks of bones and shells. They spun lines from
the fibres of Indian hemp, which they saturated with
grease and the wax of the bayberry bush, but the white
men would not use any such gear.
</p>
<p>Cod lines for use on the Grand Banks were from
50 to 75 fathoms long; the lines now used on the Georges
Bank are often as much as 150 fathoms long. Sinkers
(conical plummets of lead), were from 3 to 8 pounds in
weight according to the strength of the tidal current
where the fishing vessel anchored. The enthusiastic
John Smith said: "Is it not pretty sport to pull up two
pence, six pence and twelve pence as fast as you can haul
and veer a line?" But the fishermen who stood at the
rail, in freezing weather, hauling a wet line that was
75 fathoms or more in length, and weighted with 8 pounds

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
of lead and a 100-pound codfish, did not find it exactly
"pretty sport." Moreover, hauling and veering did not
end their work, for when the school of fish was lost, the
catch had to be cleaned and salted, even though the men
had been at the rail day and night for 48 hours. But the
work afforded better opportunities for "getting on," and
so they found in it the "pleasing content" of which Smith
also speaks.
</p>
<p>As the reader knows, stoves were not invented until
many years later, but the fishermen made shift by carrying
a half hogshead nearly filled with sand. In the centre
of the sand they scooped a hole in which the fire was built.
By means of such a fire, built on deck, they cooked their
food, warmed themselves, and dried their wet clothing.
The scene where a fleet of fishermen anchored together
on the banks by night, and all together cooked their suppers
by the flaring fires, was memorable. One sees how easy
it was for the imaginative sailor to name such a tub of
fire a "galley," the name applied to the modern ship's
kitchen.
</p>
<p>In food supplies the New Englanders naturally fared
better than their old-country competitors. Being nearer
home, they had fresh vegetables for a greater proportion
of the time afloat. Food was cheaper, too, and the circumstances
or conditions under which the food was produced
made them more lavish in using it. They raised
their own peas and had barrels of them at home; why
should they stint themselves on the Banks? To this

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
day American ships are noted for superior food and hard
work. Of course they ate plenty of fish, as all fishermen
did, and they caught many sea-birds, of which they made
savory dishes.
</p>
<p>John Smith emphasizes the fact that in the English
ships the catch was divided into three parts, of which the
crew received only a third, the two-thirds going to the
owner and the merchant who fitted out the expedition.
Where one man owned and outfitted the ship, he took
the two-thirds, of course. But as Weeden, in his <i>Economic
History of New England</i> (quoting Bourne's <i>Wells and
Kennebunk</i>), shows, in 1682-1685, if not earlier, "the
capitalist fitting out the expedition with boat, provisions,
seines, &amp;c., took one-half the value of the catch, and
the other part went to the crew." In the eighteenth
century the share of the capitalist was reduced to one-fifth.
</p>
<p>The whale fishery of the first half of the seventeenth
century was of small importance in comparison with that
of later years, but it is still worth mention. The chief
source of oil and bone seems to have been found in the
whales that died from natural causes and drifted to the
beach. But men did go afloat in chase when the spouting
spray and vapor were seen from the shore, and laws were
provided at an early day to regulate the catch. The
General Court, under these laws, took a share of all drift
whales&mdash;from two barrels to a third of the whole product.
In the chase the first harpoon that held its place claimed
the whale. It was provided "5ly, that no whael shall be

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
needlessly or fouellishly lansed behind ye vitall." The
most important fact here is that at first the men who
killed a whale shared equally. Later, when the men of
superior skill claimed shares in proportion to the work
they did, the "lay" system was evolved. The captain
of a ship received from 1 barrel in 17 to 1 in 25; in recent
years still more. Mates had from 1 in 30 to 1 in 50.
The men who threw the harpoon had 1 in 75, say, while
foremast men had still less, even down to 1 in 200 for a
green hand. No better system for encouraging men to
do as well as they could has ever been devised.
</p>
<p>Of similar importance was the custom then prevailing
of allowing the crews of merchant ships to carry a "private
venture." When Skipper Cornell's Ewoutsen, in a Dutch
cruiser, captured four New England ketches "in the
neighborhood of Blocx Island," Captain Richard Hollingworth,
commanding of one of the four, declared that he
was "freighted on account of Wharton and Company,
merchants of Boston, with 47 tubs of tobacco; <i>Item</i>,
6 tubs of tobacco for Mathew Cartwright and 13 tubs for
himself and crew ... in all 66 tubs, with eight hides."
The crew owned nearly a fifth of the cargo. (N. Y. C.
docs. II, 662.) Seamen before the mast as well as officers
took from port, in stated quantities, any commodities
which they supposed they could sell to advantage in any
of the ports to which the ship was bound. Here or there
these goods were exchanged for others, which were again
traded at other ports, or carried home to be sold. Wages

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
were not so very low for common sailors, even by modern
standards. They received on an average £2 10<i>s.</i> per
month. Mates had, say, £3 10<i>s.</i>, and captains £4 10<i>s.</i>,
and, rarely, £6 a month. On top of this the private
venture was carried free, and the shrewd sailormen often
made much more on the private venture than from wages.
It is a matter of much importance.
</p>
<p>The sailor, having a direct interest in the voyage, made
haste to shorten sail when a squall threatened to carry
away the masts; he worked with all his might whenever
any danger threatened, because she carried his merchandise.
More important still is the fact that the custom made
merchants of the men, and that is to say, it made them
self-respecting and ambitious. There were instances
where the crew received no wages whatever; the owner,
master, and men were all adventurers together.
</p>
<p>There is no more instructive comparison in the history
of the nation than that between these early-day merchants
of the forecastle and the driven brutes before the mast
in the clippers of a later day.
</p>
<p>Consider now the influence of the poverty of the builder
upon the character of the ship. Capital was so scarce
that a man worth £4000 was called wealthy. Ships were
built where scarcely a shilling in currency changed hands.
The workmen were paid with goods. Where neighbors
united to build a vessel, they traded produce of fishery
field, or forest to the merchant for such iron, sails, and
cordage as they needed, or they gave him a share in the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
vessel. The merchant traded the produce of the fisheries
or forest in Europe for the outfit he gave to the builders.
By hard labor and severe economy only were these vessels
sent afloat. It was the European fashion of the day to
build ships with enormous cabins piled high at the stern
end, and to ornament the superstructures with carvings
and paints. The New Englanders, having no capital
to spare, had to forego the pleasure of ornamenting their
ships with decorated superstructures; they were obliged
to consider efficiency only. They did not know it at the
time, but the fact was that this enforced economy led to
an advance in the art of ship-building. On navigating
the ships without superstructures, it was seen that the tall
cabins had made the ships top-heavy, and had served to
strain instead of strengthen the hulls. Moreover, the
huge pile of timber had held the ship back in any winds
but the fairest. Ships without superstructures were
stronger, of greater capacity, swifter and handier.
</p>
<p>Then there were the geographical influences which
affected the model and rigs of ships. Whether in fishing
or coasting voyages, the American ship must be prepared
to meet winds from any point of the compass on every
day she was out of port. The prevailing winds were
westerly, but there was neither trade wind nor monsoon.
The ship must therefore be rigged to force her way ahead
against adverse winds. For such winds the spritsails,
lugs, and others, where the cloth was stretched fore and
aft, rather than to yards hung square across the masts,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
were more convenient. The schooner was a natural
evolution of the coasting conditions.
</p>
<p>The waters of the harbors were shallow. In England
deep-water ports had favored deep hulls, but the American
designer who wished to increase the capacity of a hull
had to make it wider instead of deeper. Wide beam
gave greater stability; a wide ship could carry wide sails
and yet "stand up like a church" in a heavy wind. Of
course stout masts were needed for wide sails, but the
forests were full of enormous pines that could be had,
at first, for the cutting. Wide hulls of shoal draft, with
wide sails spread upon stout spars, made speedy ships, a
fact that even now is not as well understood as it should be.
The speedy ships invited their masters to "carry on"&mdash;to
keep their sails spread full breadth while the gale increased
to a weight that would "take the sticks out of" vessels of
inferior design. The swift ship, well driven, soon brought
fame as well as additional profit to crew and owners, and
the pride in the ship which was thus developed led all who
were in any way connected with her to look for still further
improvements.
</p>
<p>The short distances between harbors also had some
influence upon the forms of ships. For one thing, short
passages favored small vessels with small crews. The
greater the number of vessels, the greater the number of
captains accustomed to responsibility, a matter of no small
importance in its effect upon the formation of the sea habit
among a people. Then the short passage naturally led

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the crew into taking chances; they would risk a growing
gale in a short run. Once out of port in "dirty weather,"
the manifest dangers set all hands thinking of improved
ways of shortening sail in an emergency, and of improved
shapes of hull and cut of canvas to help a vessel to "claw
off" a lee shore. The men who worked in the shipyard
building for themselves, and then went afloat, were particularly
observant at such times. One of the most common
statements to be found in the stories of perils at sea, as
related by American shipmasters of other days, is this:
"Every dollar I owned in the world was in that ship, and"
for that reason every hardship was endured and every
effort made to bring her to port.
</p>
<p>In 1624 the Pilgrims exported their first cargo of fish.
Boston sent its first cargo away in 1633. The owners
of these fish had to pay three or four pounds a ton freight;
and an agent in England, who charged a good commission
for doing so, found a customer to buy them. The New
Englanders saw that the vessel carrying the cargo made
a profit for her owner. They saw, too, that an agent in
a foreign country across the water would never have quite
the interest in selling to advantage that they themselves
would have if they were there to sell. In short, if the fish
business were to be handled in the most profitable way
possible, they must carry the cargo in their own ship direct
to the consumer. Hugh Peter preached this doctrine
with emphasis, beyond doubt, for it was he who led in
building the 300-ton ship at Salem. From catching fish

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
to carrying them to the oversea market was a short passage
quickly made. With this in mind, consider the brief story
of the voyage of the good ship <i>Trial</i>, Captain Thomas
Coytemore, made after the fishing business was well in hand.
</p>
<p>The <i>Trial</i>, as noted, was the ship built in Boston when
the people there were stirred to emulation by the work of
Hugh Peter in Salem. Loaded with fish and pipe-staves,
she sailed away to Fayal (1642). Fayal was chosen because
the people there had religious views leading them
to eat fish instead of flesh on many days of the year, and
they were wine-makers who used many casks every year.
The <i>Trial</i> found the market at Fayal "extraordinary
good," and Captain Coytemore exchanged the fish and
staves for wine, sugar, etc., which he carried to St. Christopher's,
in the West Indies. There he traded wine for
cotton, tobacco, and some iron which the people had taken
from a ship that had been wrecked on the coast, and was
then visible, though so far under water that the wreckers
had abandoned all work upon it. As the New Englanders
were exceedingly anxious to get all kinds of iron things
used about a ship, Captain Coytemore must needs have
a look at the wreck, and after due examination, he determined
to try to recover more of the wreckage. Slinging
a "diving tub" (doubtless a good stout cask, well weighted,
and with the open end down), above the hulk, he got into
it, and having been lowered to the sunken deck, made
shift to hook good stout grapnels to the valuable things
lying within reach.

Comparisons, though sometimes odious, may be excused
when instructive. The conditions of life in Canada
led the French to devote themselves to furs only. The
Dutch at Manhattan Island were absorbed in furs and
the trade of the West India Company. The Virginians
and the English West Indians devoted themselves almost
exclusively to producing tobacco and sugar by means of
slave labor.
</p>
<p>Under the conditions of life in New England, the people
became perforce farmers, growing their own food; loggers,
cutting timber in the near-by forest for use in building
houses, fishing smacks, and ships; fishermen, going afloat
in the smacks and then curing the catch on the beach;
seamen, who, blow high or blow low, carried the catch in
their own ships direct to the consumer; traders, meeting
the competition of the keenest merchants in the world;
inventors, who, when unable to do their work by methods
already in use, promptly improvised something new that
would serve the purpose.

<h2>CHAPTER III
<br />
<span class="s08">EVOLUTION OF THE SMUGGLER AND THE PIRATE</span>
</h2>
<p><span class="b20">A</span>MONG the first acts of the English Parliament
for the regulation of the commerce of the American
colonies, notable here, was that passed in
1646, by which it was provided that no colonial produce
should be carried away to foreign ports except in vessels
under the British flag.
</p>
<p>Since the days of Raleigh, who had done his utmost
to create the sea habit among his countrymen, the English
people had been growing jealous of the enterprising Dutch,
who then were carrying the commerce of the world. This
act was a measure to restrain the freedom of the Dutch
carrying trade and to give it to English (including colonial)
ships. In 1650, although England was yet torn by civil
war, Parliament prohibited all foreign ships from trading
with the colonies without first obtaining a license. A year
later came the culminating act of the Protector's Parliament,
"the famous Act of Navigation," as McCulloch
calls it (London edition, 1839, p. 817). It provided that
no goods produced or manufactured in <i>Asia</i>, <i>Africa</i>, or
<i>America</i> should be imported into any part of the English domain

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
except in ships belonging to English subjects whereof
the master and more than half the crew were Englishmen.
The importation of <i>European</i> goods was prohibited
except in English ships, or ships belonging to the country
where the goods were produced, or those of the country
from which they could only be or were most usually exported.
As is well known, this act was intended as a final
blow at the Dutch carrying trade.
</p>
<p>Consider, now, that "shipping" means one thing,
"commerce" or "trade" another. While modern American
"commerce" is increasing in a way that seems marvellous,
American shipping has been almost entirely driven from
the foreign "carrying trade." The English enactments
relating to the colonies, from the settlement of Virginia
down to and including the "famous Act of Navigation,"
were all designed to favor all colonial commerce as well
as shipping.
</p>
<p>After the Restoration, Parliament passed what is known
as the Navigation Act of 1660, which was followed by
another in 1663, which was still more stringent. The
object of these laws, as expressly stated in the later act
itself, was in part "the maintaining the greater correspondence
and kindness between subjects at home and
those in the plantations; keeping the colonies in a firmer
dependence upon the mother country; making them yet
more beneficial to it; ... it being the usage of other
nations to keep their plantation trade exclusively to themselves."
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
To this end it was first "enacted" (to quote McCulloch),
"that certain <i>specified</i> articles, the produce of the colonies,
and since well known in commerce by the name of <i>enumerated</i>
articles, should not be exported <i>directly</i> from the
colonies to any foreign countries, but that they should
first be sent to Britain, and there unladen (the words
of the act are, <i>laid upon the shore</i>), before they could be
forwarded to their final destination. Sugar, molasses,
ginger, fustic, tobacco, cotton and indigo were originally
enumerated; and the list was subsequently enlarged by
the addition of coffee, hides and skins, iron, corn [<i>i.e.</i>
grain], lumber, &amp;c."
</p>
<p>That is to say, the colonists were compelled to take the
<i>enumerated</i> products to England and there lay them "upon
the shore." The restriction was laid upon the "commerce"
of the colonists; there was no restriction upon the
use of colonial ships.
</p>
<p>The writer begs the indulgence of intelligent readers
while he treats this matter as if for a kindergarten. From
the days of McCulloch to the present time no one has
sufficiently emphasized the difference between commerce
and shipping, a distinction that must be made entirely
plain before one can see clearly just how these navigation
acts affected the American merchant marine.
</p>
<p>Having compelled the colonies to send all their enumerated
products to England (it was not necessary to <i>sell</i>
them there; they could be reëxported under certain regulations),
Parliament went still further in its effort to

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
maintain a "greater correspondence and kindness" between
the colonists and the home subjects, by enacting,
in 1663, that "no commodity of the growth, production or
manufacture of Europe, shall be imported into the British
plantations but such as are laden and put on board in
England, Wales, or Berwick-upon-Tweed," and in English-built
shipping with an English crew.
</p>
<p>The export <i>trade</i> of the colonies was to be restricted
for the benefit of the merchants of England; so also was
this import trade. Whether so intended or not, the restrictions
resulted in a lowering of the prices of the colonial
enumerated products when sent to England, because the
market was glutted. At the same time the prices of the
European products, which the colonist wished to buy,
were, with few exceptions, greatly enhanced. The colonial
producer was robbed by the artificial reduction of the
selling price of his products, and the artificial increase
of the price he paid for his European goods&mdash;robbed
twice by arbitrary laws.
</p>
<p>In 1672 Parliament passed another act still further
to increase the "correspondence and kindness" existing
between the colonials and the subjects living in the mother-country.
A heavy tax was laid upon the commerce between
the colonies.
</p>
<p>"By these successive regulations," says Robertson,
"the plan of securing to England a monopoly of its colonies
... was perfected."
</p>
<p>It should now be interesting to note the actual influence

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
of all this legislation upon the colonial <i>merchant
marine</i>. On July 4, 1631, Massachusetts had launched
her first ship, a vessel of 30 tons. In 1676 Randolph reported
that her people owned 30 ships of from 100 to
250 tons' burden, 200 of from 50 to 100 tons, 200 of from
30 to 50 tons, and 300 of from 6 to 10 tons, the latter being
chiefly fishing smacks, though some were engaged in the
coasting trade. The colony owned 430 vessels as large
or larger than the <i>Blessing of the Bay</i>. Many ships
were also owned in the other New England colonies. In
1678 New York owned "5 smale ships and a Ketch"
that were in the coasting trade.
</p>
<p>Sir Josiah Child, a notable Englishman engaged in the
trade with America, said, in a book which he wrote on
commercial matters:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"Of all the American plantations his Majesty has none
so apt for building of shipping as New England, nor any
comparably so qualified for the breeding of seamen, not
only by reason of the <i>natural industry</i> of that people,
but principally by reason of their cod and mackerel
fisheries." And to this he adds a statement which for the
first time gave expression to what has since been known
as the "American Peril." He said, "And, in my poor
opinion, there is nothing more prejudicial and in prospect
more dangerous to any mother kingdom than the increase
of shipping in her colonies."
</p>
<p>All this is to say that while Parliament had passed
three acts that were confessedly intended to prohibit a

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
part, and hamper all of the colonial <i>trade</i>, except that
with the mother-country; and while these acts had proved
injurious and vexatious to the colonial producers and
merchants, the colonial <i>shipping</i>, the merchant marine,
had had such a vigorous growth that it was alarming the
ship-owners who lived in England.
</p>
<p>This condition of affairs becomes all the more interesting
when it is remembered that a restriction of colonial
trade was likely to affect colonial shipping indirectly, at
any rate; that is, through a reduction in the amount of
cargo to be carried. This injury was sure to appear in
any reduction of trade between the colonies, and it was
certain to affect the ships trading on owner's account first
of all.
</p>
<p>One easily finds a variety of reasons why colonial
shipping had grown so rapidly in spite of legislation adverse
to trade. For one thing, good ships were built in
New England for £4 per ton burden&mdash;carrying capacity;
the cost in England was higher. Charnock says it was a
little less than £6 there, while Sir Josiah Child says it
was from £7 to £8. Whatever the difference, it is a
memorable fact that the mechanics in New England received
higher wages than those in the old country.
</p>
<p>Naturally many merchants of England bought colony-built
ships, and this proved beneficial indirectly to all
colonial shipping. The New England shipyards were
full of orders the year round. The percentage of the inhabitants
engaged in building ships and in supplying the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
ships' builders with forest and farm products was therefore
very large. These forest and farm owners, as well as
the shipyard hands and the crews of colonial vessels, helped
to cultivate the sea habit among all the people. Then
the farms were all within driving distance of navigable
water; all farm surplus exported, either abroad or to
other colonies, went in ships, and the farmer from the
most remote plantation was not unlikely to see his produce
loaded upon a ship of some kind. In fact, many a man
behind the plough could "hand, reef and steer."
</p>
<p>Reference has already been made to the resourcefulness
of the American seaman of the period, but it may be said
again that the manner of life of the people&mdash;the fact that
"even at the end of the colonial period the average American
led a life of struggling and privation"&mdash;made American
crews the most efficient in the world. Captain John
Gallop, in a sloop of twenty tons, manned by two men
and two boys, was, in 1636, not only able to take care of
his vessel in a gale of wind but to retake another sloop
that had been captured by the Indians. Many vessels
traded to the West Indies with but five men and a boy on
board. Raleigh had mourned because Dutch ships, in
his day, needed no more than half as many sailors as
English ships, but in 1676 the New England ships needed
less than the Dutch or any other ships. It was when
contemplating a New England ship manned by a New
England crew that Sir Josiah Child discovered the
"American Peril." He saw that a colonial ship manned

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
by a colonial crew <i>was more efficient</i> than the same ship
manned by any other crew, and that is a most important
fact in this story.
</p>
<p>A most interesting cause of the growth of the colonial
merchant marine is found in the bounties which the navigation
laws offered to, and the facilities they provided for,
those who would engage in clandestine trade. It was
unlawful to carry tobacco from the colonies direct to a
foreign port, but the export of fish and staves was permitted.
Importations of salt were permitted, but Spanish
iron must be purchased in England at a time when Spanish
iron was the best in the world for ship-builder's use. The
restriction on tobacco lowered the price in the colonies;
that on the iron raised the price there. If tobacco were
clandestinely exported direct to Spain and iron brought
directly home, the ship made far greater profits than in
the days before the hated laws. Moreover, the smuggled
cargo paid no tariff-for-revenue dues or port charges.
And it was easy to smuggle in any kind of a cargo.
</p>
<p>In connection with this provision of a bounty on smuggling,
consider the influence of the fact that the laws were
intentionally unfair to the colonists. The colonists resented
the injustice, and all the more because their trade
previous to the enactment of the laws had been free.
Then the conditions under which the laws were enforced
were inquisitorial and otherwise vexatious. A time came
when forts were built and revenue cutters were provided
for the enforcing of the laws, and the officials of forts

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and cutters were insolent and overanxious to confiscate
accused ships.
</p>
<p>Recall, now, the mental attitude of the colonists toward
all authority. Some had emigrated from England to
escape religious tyranny. Many had come over as indentured
servants, looking forward to a time when they
should be free, and become men of influence. Then all
the conditions of colonial life, and especially its dangers,
cultivated a feeling of manly independence of all authority.
Finally, the colonists had from the first made at least their
local laws according to their own standards of right.
</p>
<p>"It is not unknown to you that they look upon themselves
as a free State ... there being many against
owning the King, or having any dependence on Engld."
(Letter dated March 11, 1660.)
</p>
<p>In short, the colonists had been rapidly developing the
American habit of doing what they happened to believe
to be right, regardless of the law in the case, and they
called, or were to call, this habit an appeal to the "higher
law."
</p>
<p>Inspired by honest indignation and an opportunity
to increase their profits, the colonial ship-owners and
crews, with much unanimity, appealed to the "higher law."
</p>
<p>Smuggling began as soon as attempts were made to
enforce the law. It was estimated that the losses to the
British revenue through the direct sale of tobacco to the
Dutch at Manhattan Island previous to the year 1664
amounted to £10,000 a year. When, in 1665, the king took

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
notice of colonial dereliction, by issuing instructions for a
strict enforcement of the laws, the General Court of Massachusetts
replied that they were not conscious of having
"greatly violated" them. In 1776 Edward Randolph
was sent over especially "Impowered" to prevent "Irregular
Trade," and the letters he wrote to the "Lords
Commissioners of the Council of Trade and Plantations"<a id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
are full of references to the ways of the smugglers. Other
letters of the period, especially those of Governor Bellomont,
are similarly interesting.
</p>
<p>At first the evasions were quite open. It is related that
Skipper Clæs Bret loaded the ship <i>De Sterre</i> in the Chesapeake
"in the name of an English skipper," and sent her
to the Island of Jersey. Virginia officials must have
aided this transaction. Weeden quotes from the Massachusetts
archives the story of another Dutch skipper
whose ship was seized because he "broake his word to
the Governor in not clearing his ship to belong to the
English." Governor Andros, who tried to enforce the
laws, complained because there were "noe Custom houses,"
and because the "Governor of Massachusetts gives clearings,
certificates and passes for every particular thing from
thence to New York" without inquiring whether these
things had been lawfully imported into Massachusetts.
</p>
<p>The king's instructions to Governor Dongan tell him

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
how "to prevent the acceptance of forged Cockets (which
hath been practiced to our great prejudice)." A cocket is
a document given by a customs officer to a merchant as a
certificate that the goods have been entered according to
law. Randolph reported (April, 1698) that he had asked
the Governor of Pennsylvania "to appoint an Attorney
Generall to prosecute" certain men who had aided in an
evasion of the laws, "but he did nothing in it." In the
same year Randolph was arrested in New York by aggrieved
merchants because he had, as he alleges, seized a
smuggler in Virginia, and although his case seems now to
have been according to law, Governor Bellomont had much
difficulty in getting him out of jail. No one sympathized
with a revenue official.
</p>
<p>Before Bellomont's time no official except Governor Andros
had tried to enforce the navigation acts. When Bellomont
took office, he found all New York opposing him in his
efforts to enforce them. When the ship <i>Fortune</i>, Captain
Thomas Moston, came to port, bringing cargo worth
£20,000 direct from Madagascar (where it had been purchased
of a gang of pirates), and Bellomont asked Collector
of Customs Chidley Brooks to seize her, he replied
that "it was none of his business, but belonged to a Man of
Warr; that he had no boat; and other excuses; and when
I gave him positive commands to do it, which he could not
avoid, yet his delay of four days" gave the smugglers time
to unload and conceal all of the cargo except a part estimated
to be worth £1000. Thus runs one of Bellomont's

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
letters. He also acknowledged that several cargoes had
already been smuggled in without his learning the fact until
it was too late to intercept them.
</p>
<p>In Boston, as Bellomont learned, there were various ways
of smuggling. "When ships come in the masters swear to
their manifests; that is, they swear to the number of parcels
they bring, but the contents unknown; then the merchant
comes and produces an invoice, and whether true or false
is left to his ingenuity."
</p>
<p>"If the merchants of Boston be minded to run their
goods," he continues, "there's nothing to hinder them.
Mr. Brenton, the Collector is absent and has been these two
years; his deputy is a merchant; the two waiters keep
public houses, and besides that, that coast is naturall
shap'd and cut out to favour unlawful trade." It was a
"common thing to unload their ships at Cape Ann and
bring their goods to Boston in wood boats." If that were
thought too expensive the goods could be "run" within the
city, where there were "63 wharfs," or in Charlestown,
where there were fourteen more, all unguarded. French
and Spanish ships were bringing many goods to Newfoundland
and the ports of Canada, where they met
New England ships ready to "swap" cargoes. There
was lively trade carried directly to the ports of Canada
and to the French and Spanish ports of the West
Indies.
</p>
<p>After returning to New York from Boston, Bellomont
wrote that "Nassaw alias Long Island" was notorious for

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
smugglers and pirates. "There are four towns that make
it their daily practice to receive ships and sloops with all
sorts of merchandise, tho' they be not allowed ports."
They were "so lawless and desperate a people" that
the governor could "get no honest man" to go among
them to collect the revenue. From Long Island the goods
were brought to New York by wagons and small boats.
"There is a town called Stamford in Connecticut colony"
where "one Major Selleck lives who has a warehouse
close to the Sound.... That man does us great mischief
with his warehouse for he receives abundance of
goods, and the merchants afterwards take their opportunity
of running them into this town." During Bellomont's
time Selleck's warehouse was the favorite resort
of the merchants doing business with the Madagascar
pirates. Selleck had £10,000 worth of the goods which
Captain Kidd brought from the East.
</p>
<p>Turning now to the stories of the pirates, we read that
when one Captain Cromwell, a pirate with three ships,
manned by eighty men, came to Plymouth in 1646, and
remained five or six weeks with the Pilgrims, Governor
Bradley referred to the visit in these words:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"They spente and scattered a great deal of money among
ye people, and yet more, sine, than money."
</p>
<p>The statement that the Pilgrims (of all others!) entertained
the pirates so well as to detain them for weeks
in the harbor is somewhat shocking to one not fully acquainted
with the conditions of commerce in that period.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
The facts regarding the pirates seem worth, therefore,
some consideration.
</p>
<p>While pirates were found upon the ocean as soon as other
ships in the early history of the world, some of the piracy
affecting the early commerce of the colonies grew out of a
curious system of private reprisals that was previously
countenanced by European governments. Thus, when
the Inquisition in the Canary Islands seized the property
of Andrew Barker, an Englishman, in 1576, and he was
unable to obtain redress from any Spanish authority, he,
with the permission of his government, "fitted out two
barks to revenge himself." He captured enough Spanish
merchantmen to recoup his loss with interest. His commission
was called a letter of marque and reprisal.
</p>
<p>Then recall the system of forcing trade that was practised
in the West Indies. Sir John Hawkins sold slaves to the
Spanish at the muzzles of his guns. Eventually Sir
John's fleet was "bottled up" in Vera Cruz by a Spanish
squadron and destroyed. Drake was one of the men
ruined by this act of Spanish "perfidy," and to recoup his
losses he began the series of raids by which he acquired
fortune and a title.
</p>
<p>Reprisals led to wanton aggressions, like those of the
buccaneers, and wanton aggressions produced reprisals
again. All governments encouraged their merchantmen
to rob those of rival peoples as a means of promoting commerce,
just as the warring fur traders on the American frontier
were encouraged in their fights waged to the same end.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
The encouragement of reprisals was at all times more or
less covert. In war times the armed merchantmen were
openly commissioned and sent afloat not only to prey upon
the ships of the enemy but upon those of neutral powers
as well. It was the theory of all statesmen that the best
way to encourage the shipping of one nation was to injure
as much as possible, and by all means, the shipping of all
rivals. As late as the end of the eighteenth century the
Barbary pirates were subsidized by some governments to
encourage them to prey upon the shipping of rivals.
</p>
<p>At one time the privateer captain was the judge of the
offending of the neutral. Later, when privateers were
obliged to carry captured ships before a court of admiralty,
the difference between the robbery as committed by the
privateer and the confiscation ordered by the court was
found only in the course of procedure.
</p>
<p>A theorist here and there denounced the systems of
reprisals and privateering. Governor Bradford was worried
somewhat by the doings of Cromwell's men. Government
officials denounced as pirates the privateers who
smuggled in goods instead of bringing them in openly and
paying the usual fees and duties. But the state of civilization
warranted the Pilgrims in the warmth of the reception
they gave to the pirates.
</p>
<p>How far the piratical cruisers influenced the American
merchant marine is not definitely told in the documents,
but it is certain that damage was inflicted. We get a
glimpse of a vicious raid in the story of a French pirate

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
(perhaps he had a commission, however) named Picor,
who landed on Block Island in July, 1689. The pirates "remained
in possession of the island, plundering the houses,
and despoiling it of every moveable thing," for a week.
Two of the islanders were tortured to make them reveal the
hiding-place of valuables, and two negroes were killed.
</p>
<p>From the island the pirates went to New London, but
they were driven away. On sailing toward the open sea
once more, they were intercepted by two armed sloops
that had been sent out from Newport under one Captain
Paine. <i>A Naval History of Rhode Island</i> says that Paine
had "followed the privateering design" in former years
as a lieutenant under Picor, and that the Frenchman, on
recognizing him, fled, saying he "would as soon fight the
devil as Paine."
</p>
<p>In the <i>Canadian Archives</i> (1894) are two stories of
raids upon French possessions, made in one case by
"Englishmen" (they took Quebec), and in the other
by "the people of Massachusetts."
</p>
<p>Many letters charging various colonies with encouraging
pirates are found in the old documents. Rhode Island,
New York, and the two Carolinas were accused in this way
more frequently than the others, and New York was the
chief offender in the days of Governor Benjamin Fletcher
(1692-1697). While the buccaneers were ravaging the
Spanish mainland, another horde found opportunity in
the conditions prevailing on the coast of Asia. These
latter pirates formed a settlement upon Madagascar Island,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
wherein gold and jewels were abundant, but such products
of civilization as rum and weapons were scarce and much
wanted. New York merchants usually supplied these
wants, but New Englanders sent them at least one cargo of
masts and yards for their ships. The merchant captains
engaged in this supply trade also took a turn at piracy whenever
opportunity offered. Governor Fletcher did a thriving
business in supplying captains with commissions when
they sailed, and "protections" when they returned. Captain
Edward Coates, of the ship <i>Jacob</i>, said that he paid
£1300 for "his share" of the price of the commission with
which the ship sailed. At the end of the voyage the
crew "shared the value of 1800 pieces of eight, a man."
Fletcher took the ship, valued at £800, for his bribe when
he allowed Coates to land the cargo. The sailors had to
pay the governor from seventy-five to one hundred pieces
of eight for "protections."
</p>
<p>Captain Giles Shelly, of the ship <i>Nassau</i>, carried rum
which cost two shillings a gallon to Madagascar, and sold it
for from fifty shillings to three pounds a gallon. "A pipe
of Madeira wine which cost him £19 he sold for £300."
</p>
<p>Captain William Kidd was the most notorious of the
captains engaged in the Madagascar trade, but the story
of his career is interesting chiefly because of the light it
throws upon the state of civilization then prevailing. His
troubles began when Lord Bellomont and some other
noble lords of England fitted out a private armed ship to go
to Madagascar and rob the pirates. Bellomont describes

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
this venture as "very honest." Kidd was chosen to command
the ship&mdash;<i>The Adventure Galley</i>. On arriving at
Madagascar, he found that the pirates had a stronger ship
than his, and he was afraid to attack them. The crew had
been shipped on the usual privateer plan of no prize, no
pay, and on finding they were to get no prize they became
mutinous. Many of them deserted to the pirates of the
island. In a half-hearted effort to maintain discipline
among those remaining, Kidd hit a man with a bucket and
happened to kill him. Then he went cruising, pirate fashion,
and captured a ship belonging to "the Moors," which
was valued at £30,000. In this ship Kidd sailed for home.
He learned, on the way, that he had been proclaimed as a
pirate. Bellomont had been accused by political enemies
in Parliament of fitting out a piratical cruiser, and being
unwilling to face the charge by telling the facts frankly, he
shuffled, told falsehoods, and eventually made a scapegoat
of Kidd, who was hanged (May 12, 1701).
</p>
<p>That this man, who at worst had killed one man in a
sea brawl, and had taken one ship, should have had ballads
written about him in which he was described as "bloody"
is one of the most remarkable facts in the history of the sea.
But that he should have been referred to ever since in all
literature as a typical pirate is still more remarkable.
</p>
<p>A book, Hughson's <i>Carolina Pirates and Colonial Commerce</i>,
has been written to tell about the deeds of such men
as Bane, Stede Bonnet, Moody, and Edward Thatch, or
Blackbeard, but it has little to say about the influence of

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
the pirates upon commerce, because there is little to say.
The pirates mentioned captured a few ships, American as
well as English, and for brief periods interrupted the trade
of various ports. On the other hand, some of them supplied
the colonists with low-priced goods, and at times the only
coin in circulation was that brought in by the freebooters.
</p>
<p>On the whole, in a financial point of view, the pirates benefited
the young merchant marine more than they damaged
it. In anticipation of attacks by pirates, all ships in deep-water
trade carried cannon, and some coasters did so,
especially in the longer voyages. In the trade with Spain
and Portugal and the Canary Islands the American vessels
were often chased, and sometimes captured, by Barbary
pirates who had learned their trade from European renegades.
New England ships in the West Indies were
always obliged to keep a sharp lookout for piratical cruisers
under French and Spanish flags. But these aggressions
were not an unmixed evil. For such conditions increased
freight rates and the profits on cargoes carried on
owners' account. Thus the freight rate from Boston to
Barbados, in 1762, was "14 per ton or four times former
rates," and all because of pirates. Sure fortune came to
the ship captain who was equal to the emergencies of the
trade. Dangers cultivated the courage and enterprise of
the crews. In a still broader view the habits of a people
soon to become an independent nation were forming, and it
was well worth while for some of them to learn how to
swim in rough water.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV
<br />
<span class="s08">BEFORE THE WAR OF THE REVOLUTION</span>
</h2>
<p><span class="b20">T</span>WO of the trades in which the ships of the American
colonies were largely engaged during the
seventeenth century are of special interest here&mdash;the
whale fishery and the slave trade. It was in 1712
that Captain Christopher Hussey, while off Nantucket, in an
open boat, looking for whales, was blown away to sea, where
he killed a sperm whale, the profitable sale of which led the
people of his famous home island to go cruising in deep
water for more whales of the kind. The growth of the fishery
that followed was swift. In 1730 Nantucket alone had
twenty-five deep-water whalers, and they brought home oil
and bone that sold for £3200. In the meantime the islanders
had begun sending their products directly to London,
thus establishing a new line of trade. With the increase
of profits came an extension of the territory where
the search for whales was made. In 1751 they went to
Disco Island in the mouth of Baffin's Bay. In 1763 they
were found on the coast of Guinea (looking for whales and
ignoring the slave trade), and that, too, in spite of the wars
that had covered the seas with pirates. In 1767 no less
than fifty whalers crossed the equator "by way of experiment."

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
That statement is perhaps the most significant of
any that can be made of the fishery. Nantucket alone
owned 125 whalers in 1770; they were, on the average, 93
tons' burden in size, and in the course of the year they
brought home 14,331 barrels of oil worth $358,200 as soon
as landed.
</p>
<p>These facts are of special interest to the story of the
American merchant marine for several reasons. The oil
and bone formed an important part of what a farmer
might call the cash crops of the nation. Then the
whalers were producers whose work added to the comfort
and prosperity of the world. Travellers from Europe
were astonished to learn that America was a land where "no
one begged." Nantucket was a community not only where
no one begged but where every man was a capitalist, or at
worst had capital within reach. For every man went
whaling, or might do so, and a "greasy" voyage made
every member of the ship's crew rich enough to buy shares
in a whale ship. The "lay" of the whale ship was like
the private venture of the freighter. Further than that
the whaler carried a number of petty officers found on no
other kind of a ship&mdash;the "boatsteerers." The ambitious
youth before the mast found promotion nearer at hand.
Many a youth who went afloat as a "greenhorn" returned
proudly wearing the badge of the boatsteerer. It
was a matter of no small importance in a country wherein
were many bond-servants looking forward to freedom and
an opportunity to rise in the world.
</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>More important still was the influence of the adventures
enjoyed and dangers risked by the whalers. Wherever
whale-oil was burned, men were found telling the tales of
the sea. The people who listened were peculiarly susceptible,
for they had come across the sea, looking for new
lands and opportunities, or they were the immediate descendants
of those who had done so. When Captain Shields
led the way around Cape Horn, he not only aroused a spirit
of emulation in all other whalers, but he inspired a whole
people. As they listened to the story the people of the
interior were reminded that the streams before their doors
were dimpling highways to the sea and the wonder world
beyond its borders; and there were no other highways
worth mention in the country in those days.<a id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
</p>
<p>In every story of the slave trade one must remember that
modern readers are able only with great difficulty to
obtain the right point of view.
</p>
<p>We err greatly in judging the people of the seventeenth
century by the standards of the twentieth. There was
work to do&mdash;the world's work&mdash;and many of the workers,
though they saw dimly, or not at all, the task in hand, were
so eager to do their share of it that they voluntarily sold
themselves into bondage in order to go about it. Were such
men as these, or their contemporaries, likely to see anything
wrong in compelling the less developed but strong-armed
Africans to take hold and "keep the ball rolling"?

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Manifestly, slavery was an unavoidable feature of the evolution
of the race, and the slave-owners of yesterday were as
well justified in their belief that slavery was just, as we are
in our belief that the able financier&mdash;the good business
man&mdash;is entitled to a much greater share of the good
things of life than a man of different mental caliber&mdash;say
a college professor, for example.
</p>
<p>The traffic in slaves followed immediately upon demand.
Says Winthrop's <i>Journal</i>:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"One of our ships which went to the Canaries with pipe-staves
in the beginning of November last, [1644] returned
now and brought wine, and sugar and salt and some tobacco
which she had at Barbadoes in exchange for Africans
which she carried from the Isle of Maio."
</p>
<p>The <i>Desire</i>, with her slaves from Providence, was the
first American slaver, but long before the end of the seventeenth
century the colonial ships trading to the Madeiras
and Canaries made a regular practice of slaving. For the
wine and salt which were obtained in the islands were not of
sufficient bulk to fill the holds of their ships. The enterprising
captains wanted to make use of the vacant space
between cargo and deck, and nothing they could find for
that purpose would yield as much profit as negro slaves
bought on the coast of Africa, and carried to the one-crop
colonies like Barbados and Virginia.
</p>
<p>It is true that when the captain of a Massachusetts ship
helped to raid an African village, and thus, by assault, captured
two slaves, the General Court ordered them returned

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
to Africa. But in deciding the questions arising in this
case the Court distinctly, if indirectly, affirmed the doctrine
that slaves were property: "For the negroes, (they being
none of his <i>but stolen</i>), we think meete to alowe nothing."
If he had obtained them by purchase, the Court would have
allowed him full value.
</p>
<p>Between 1585 and 1672 inclusive, six monopolistic companies
were organized in England to control the African
trade. Because of the monopolistic work of the last one,
the people of Barbados declared, at first, that it was "killing
the provision trade from New England." That is to
say, that for a time New England ships were driven from
the island trade; but the smugglers soon circumvented the
monopoly. "Interlopers" attempting to leave England
for the slave trade were easily detained at the request of the
company, but American ships were not to be so detained.
Then the company appointed agents to intercept the cargoes
brought to the Barbados ports, but all in vain.
"Armed multitudes on foot and on horseback" attacked the
unfortunate agents who tried to do their duty. Cargoes
of slaves were landed on the beach between ports while
agents slept. The work of the company simply increased
the profits of the "interlopers."
</p>
<p>When, in 1698, Parliament opened the trade to all
merchantmen, the increase of the trade was considered "so
Highly Beneficial and Advantageous to this Kingdom"
that efforts were made to secure the slave traffic of the
Spanish islands also, and with success. The most valued

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
feature of the Peace of Utrecht (March 13, 1713) was the
Assiento by which Spain agreed to permit England to
send not less than 4800 slaves every year thereafter to the
Spanish colonies.
</p>
<p>With Spanish as well as all English West India islands
open to the trade of the New England slavers, it is interesting
to note that one port soon forged ahead of all
others in the number of ships engaged in the traffic.
Rhode Island merchants secured a much greater share of it
than those of other parts of the coast. Their success appears
to have been due in part to geographical conditions.
Thus the people of Massachusetts led those of Rhode Island
in the fisheries because they lived nearer the Banks,
but they had no advantage in carrying forest and farm
products to the West Indies. In fact, Newport was
measurably nearer to Barbados than Boston was; her
ships did not have to risk the dangers of Cape Cod. This
was a small advantage, but all the more interesting on that
account. Boston gave her attention chiefly to fish; Newport
perforce made a specialty of something else, and of all
the products of the soil used in trade, within her reach,
there was nothing that gave so large a profit as molasses,
when it was the raw material for the manufacture of rum.
Newport thought to fish, at one time; a bounty was paid
on whale-oil taken by ships of the colony. But the production
of rum needed no artificial stimulation. Molasses
cost thirteen or fourteen pennies a gallon, and Rhode
Island distillers became so expert that some of them made

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
a gallon of rum from one of molasses, though the ordinary
product was 96 gallons in 100. Rum was not only cheap,
it was satisfying. Even the French Canadians bought rum,
instead of brandy from their native land.
</p>
<p>Gaining the lead in the manufacture of rum gave the
Newport merchants the lead in the slave trade, for of all
goods carried by enlightened and civilized white men to
the degraded heathen of Africa nothing proved so tempting
as this deadly stupefier.
</p>
<p>Many stories of the early slave trade remain, but none
shows the conditions as they were better than that of a
voyage made by Captain David Lindsay, in the 40-ton
brigantine <i>Sanderson</i>, belonging to William Johnson &amp;
Co., of Newport, in 1752. She sailed for the black coast
on August 22, at 11.32 o'clock, the exact minute being
noted on an astrologer's chart which the captain had obtained
as a guide. The chief part of her cargo consisted
of "80 hhds. six bbs. and 3 tierces of rum, containing 8220
gals." Lumber and staves for sale at Barbados, as well as
for use in making the slave deck, were also carried, but in
small quantities. A partial description of the vessel before
sailing says she was "tite as yet." In a letter dated "Anamaboe
28th Feb. 1753," Captain Lindsay reports progress:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"I have got 13 or 14 hhds of Rum yet left a board &amp;
God noes when I shall get clear of it. Ye traid is so dull
it is actually a noof to make a man Creasy." Officers and
men had been sick, one was likely to die, "and wors than yt

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
have wore out my small cable &amp; have been obliged to buy
one heare.... I beg you not blaime me in so doeing.
I should be glad I could come rite home with my slaves for
my vesiel will not last to proceed farr. <i>We can see day
Lite al round her bow under deck.</i>"
</p>
<p>In his next report (Barbadoes, June 17, 1759), the captain
says:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"These are to acqt you of my arivel heare ye day before
yesterday from anamaboe. I met on my passage 22 days
of very squaly winds &amp; continued Rains so that it beat my
sails alto piceses.... My slaves is not landed as yet:
they are 56 in number for owners all in helth &amp; fatt....
I've got 40 ounces gould dust &amp; eight or nine hundred
weight maligabar pepper for owners."
</p>
<p>As we see it the trade was horrible, but consider the
courage and fortitude of the captain and crew who, after
seeing "day Lite al round her bow under deck," headed
away across the ocean on a passage lasting ten weeks, during
which, for twenty-two days, they faced storms which
beat the sails to pieces and poured floods of water through
the open seams.
</p>
<p>A report of the consignee shows that forty-seven of the
slaves sold for £1432 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> The usual price of a slave on
the African coast was 110 gallons of rum. After deducting
expenses, the consignees credited the owners of the ship
with £1324. After adding the gold dust, the pepper, and
the small sums received for the lumber and staves, one
sees that the dividend on the cost of the <i>Sanderson</i> (£450)

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
was large. Of the price received for the remaining negroes,
and the profit on the molasses which was probably carried
home, nothing is said in the record. (See <i>Am. Hist.
Record</i>, August and September, 1872).
</p>
<p>The income of the slaver captain was large for that day.
In addition to the ordinary monthly wages, he received
several commissions. "You are to have four out of 104
for your coast commission," wrote the owner of the
schooner <i>Sierra Leone</i>, in which Captain Lindsay made a
voyage in 1754, "&amp; five per cent for the sale of your cargo
in the West Indies &amp; five per cent for the goods you purchase
for return cargo. You are to have five slaves Privilege,
your cheafe mate Two, if he can purchase them, &amp;
your second mate two."
</p>
<p>The "Privilege" was the "private venture" of the trade.
The foremast hands had no "privilege." Their pay was
about £3 per month.
</p>
<p>As a matter of record, to show something of the way
business was done by the ship-owners of the day, here is
a copy of a bill of lading, followed by a letter of instructions
to a captain about to sail in the slave trade:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"Shipped by the Grace of God in good order and well
conditioned, by William Johnson &amp; Co., owners of the
Sierra Leone, in &amp; upon the said Schooner Sierra Leone,

Newport, and by God's Grace bound for the Coast of
Africa: To say, Thirty-four hogsheads, Tenn Tierces,

being accomplished the other two stand void. And so
God send the good Schooner to her desired Port in Safety:
Amen."
</p>
<p>The enormous profits of the slave trade were made in
spite of active competition. In 1750 there were 101
Liverpool merchants in it, while London had 135, and
Bristol 157. The English slavers were much larger than
the American, on the average, being able to carry 300.
Nevertheless, New Rhode Island held her own well. In
1740 she had, according to <i>The American Slave Trade</i>,
120 vessels in the trade, and in 1770 the number was 150.
</p>
<p>An interesting view of the seafaring people of New

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
England in the seventeenth century is found in the autobiography
of the Rev. John Barnard, who served Marblehead
well, beginning in 1714. He says that upon his
arrival in the place "there was not so much as one proper
carpenter nor mason nor tailor nor butcher in the town.
The people contented themselves to be the slaves that
digged in the mines [figuratively speaking] and left the
merchants of Boston, Salem and Europe to carry away
the gains; by which means the town was always in dismally
poor circumstances, involved in debt to the merchants
more than they were worth; ... and they were generally
as rude, swearing, drunken and fighting a crew as they
were poor.
</p>
<p>"I soon saw that the town had a price in its hands, and
it was a pity they had not a heart to improve it. I therefore
laid myself out to get acquainted with the English
masters of vessels that I might by them be let into the
mystery of the <i>fish trade</i>; and in a little time I gained a
pretty thorough understanding of it. When I saw the
advantages of it I thought it my duty to stir up my people
... that they might reap the benefit of it.... But
alas! I could inspire no man with courage and resolution
enough to engage in it, till I met with Mr. Joseph Swet,
a young man of strick justice, great industry, enterprising
genius, quick apprehension and firm resolution, but of
small fortune. To him I opened myself fully, laid the
scheme clearly before him, and he hearkened unto me....
He first sent a small cargo to Barbadoes.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
"He soon found he increased his stock, built vessels
and sent the fish to Europe, and prospered in the trade....
The more promising young men of the town soon
followed his example," and "now, [1766] we have between
thirty and forty ships, brigs, snows and topsail schooners
engaged in foreign trade."
</p>
<p>Moreover (and it is an important matter in that it
shows one influence of shipping in that day), foreign trade
had improved the manners of the people. "We have
many gentlemanlike and polite families."

<p>One finds in the documents many glimpses and not a
few detailed stories of life in what may be called
the ordinary trades of the American merchant marine
during the eighteenth century. Here, for example,
are some extracts from a diary kept by a Salem
youth, who had recently graduated from Harvard and
was making a voyage to Gibraltar with Captain Richard
Derby, in 1759. The diary is to be found in the possession
of the East India Marine Society of Salem:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"Nov. 12.&mdash;Saw a sail standing to the S. W. I am
stationed at the aftermost gun and its opposite with
Captain Clifford. We fired a shot at her and she hoisted
Dutch colors.
</p>
<p>"15.&mdash;Between 2 and 3 this morning we saw two sail
which chased us, the ship fired three shots at us which we
returned. They came up with us by reason of a breeze
which she took before we did. She proved to be the
ship Cornwall from Bristol.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>"23.&mdash;We now begin to approach to land. At eight
o'clock two Teriffa (Barbary) boats came out after us,
they fired at us which we returned as merrily. They
were glad to get away as well as they could. We stood
after one, but it is almost impossible to come up with the
piratical dogs.
</p>
<p>"Dec.&mdash;10.... In the morning we heard a firing and
looked out in the Gut and there was a snow attacked by 3 of
the piratical Teriffa boats. Two cutters in the Government
service soon got under sail, 3 men-of-war that lay in the
road manned their barges and sent them out, as did a
privateer. We could now perceive her (the snow) to have
struck, but they soon retook her. She had only four
swivels and six or eight men.... They got some
prisoners (of the pirates) but how many I cannot learn,
which it is to be hoped will meet with their just reward
which I think would be nothing short of hanging."
</p>
<p>Tales of the resourcefulness of the foremast hands on
the colonial vessels are of special interest here. As an
example, consider that of the brig <i>Sally</i>, which turned
bottom up while on her way from Philadelphia to Santo
Domingo, on August 8, 1765. Six of the crew who were
on deck saved themselves at first by clinging to such
wreckage as floated beside the hull, and then, when the
squall was over, climbed to the upturned keel. Then, to
procure food and drink, they cut the wreath (a flat bar of
iron encircling the mainmast head) from its place, using
their jackknives, it may be supposed, and with that as

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
a tool made a hole through the bottom of the hulk. It
took six days of continuous labor, watch and watch, of
course, but they succeeded, and got out a barrel of
bottled beer and another of salt pork. During the six
days of work they subsisted without water, and with no
other food than the barnacles on the planking. Moreover,
they built a platform of staves and shingles upon the
sloping bottom of the hull, upon which they could sleep
without danger of rolling into the sea. In this fashion
they lived until September 1, twenty-three days, when they
were rescued.
</p>
<p>Of the lost rudders that were replaced with pieces of
spare spars bound together with rope, and the small boats
made by castaways who had nothing but barrel hoops and
staves with canvas for planking, no more than mention
need be made.
</p>
<p>In the log of the sloop <i>Adventure</i>, Captain Francis
Boardman, during a West India voyage, in 1774, are
found the following entries:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"This Morning I Drempt that 2 of my upper teeth and
one Lower Dropt out and another Next the Lower one wore
away as thin as a wafer and Sundry other fritful Dreams.
What will be the Event of it I can't tell."
</p>
<p>"this Blot I found the 17th. I can't tell, but Something
Very bad is going to hapen me this Voyage. I
am afeard but God onley Noes What may hapen on board
the Sloop Adventure&mdash;the first Voyage of being Master."
</p>
<p>There were terrors of the sea of which the masters were

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
more "afeard" than they were of the "Teriffa" pirates, but,
in spite of all, they held fast tack and sheet, continued
on the course, and finally told in the log-book&mdash;at least
Captain Boardman did&mdash;just what came after the dire
portents. On arriving off Boston, Boardman wrote:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"The End of this Voyage for wich I am very thankful
on Acct. of a Grate Deal of Trouble by a bad mate. His
name is William Robson of Salem. He was drunk most
part of the voyage."
</p>
<p>The Captain Richard Derby mentioned above was one
of several generations of Salem Derbys that followed the
sea with success. A letter written by him while at
Gibraltar, in 1758, gives a good idea of the state of trade
at that time:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"I wrote you the 1st instant by way of Cadiz and
Lisbon; since which I have landed my white sugar and
sold it for $17½ per cwt., and my tar I have sold at $8½
per bbl. I have not as yet sold any of my fish, nor at
present does there appear to be any buyer for it; but
as it is in very good order, and no fear of its spoiling, I
intend to keep it a little longer. I am in hopes that this
Levanter will bring down a buyer for it. I hope to get
$12 for my brown sugar. We have this day had the
Sallie delivered up to us, and intend to sell her for the
most she will fetch; as to sending her to the West Indies,
I am sure if she was loaded for St. Eustia, she would
be seized by the privateers before she got out of the road,
and having no papers but a pass, would be sufficient to

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
condemn her in the West Indies, if she should be taken
by an English cruiser. I have bought 140 casks of claret,
at $10 per cask, which I intend to bring home with me.
I have written Alicant for 500 dozen handkerchiefs, if they
can be delivered for $4 current per dozen. My cargo
home I intend shall be 140 casks of claret, 20 butts of
Mercil wine, 500 casks of raisins, some soap, and all the
small handkerchiefs I can get."
</p>
<p>By way of illustrating the dangers of losses from assaults
by armed vessels under the English flag, it should be told
that in 1759 a Salem schooner named the <i>Three Brothers</i>
was overhauled by an English privateer that took away
such specie from her as was found on board, and then
sent her to one of the West India Islands "to be robbed
again by a court of admiralty," as the senior Derby, her
owner, wrote. In 1672 another Derby vessel was captured
by a Frenchman who took a bond of, and released, her.
The old captain sent a cartel in due course to redeem the
bond, but a British warship seized her on the charge that
she was bound to a port of the enemy. The court in
England acquitted the cartel, but in the meantime the
owner of the vessel had been put to a great expense
unnecessarily, and he had no redress.
</p>
<p>Richard Derby mentioned above bought a French
prize of 300 tons at Gibraltar, loaded her with wine, and
sent her under Captain George Crowninshield to the West
Indies, where her cargo was sold to good advantage, and
sugar purchased. With this she headed away for Leghorn,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
but was taken by an English privateer on the plea that
she had no register. As a matter of fact the voyage was
entirely lawful; she had no register, but being a purchased
prize, she did not need one until she should be able to go
to an English port. Nevertheless, when the vessel was
taken before the court in the Bahamas, she was at once
condemned. It was sheer robbery. The records of that
court showed that, of 200 ships that had been brought
in, the only ones escaping condemnation were a few belonging
to owners who had been willing to pay the judge
a higher price than the privateers were. The governor
of the colony as well as this judge had gone to their posts
poor, but in a few years they retired worth fortunes of
£30,000 each.
</p>
<p>The Derby vessels were seized in each case on the charge
that they had violated one or another section of the navigation
laws. The navigation laws had at last begun to
injure the shipping of the colonial owners. A remarkable
change had taken place in the condition of affairs. What
had happened, and through what agencies had the change
come?
</p>
<p>A small space only is needed for a statement of the important
facts, but the reader is reminded that here, as in
the case of slavery, it is difficult to get the right point of
view. The eighteenth-century state of morality, not that
of the twentieth, prevailed.
</p>
<p>From the beginning of the eighteenth century until
well past the middle, England was constantly at war with

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
France and Spain in spite of treaties that were made from
time to time to provide for peace. There was never a
day from 1700 to 1763 when the ships of either nation were
free to sail the seas unmolested. It was the period during
which Lord Clive fought the battles of his country in
the East Indies, and when, in America, the frontiersman
never saw the sun set without a well-grounded fear that
the night would bring bloodthirsty and fiendishly cruel
enemies prowling around his cabin. According to the
documents that remain, these long wars were seemingly
no more than disputes over boundaries (neighborhood
quarrels over line fences), or efforts to avenge some such
personal injury as that when Captain Jenkins had his ear
cut off by the Spaniards while sailing near the coast of
Cuba. But as seen now, each seemingly petty quarrel
was but a feature of a prolonged struggle between races
for the commercial control of the New World.
</p>
<p>"Shall half the World be England's for industrial
purposes, ... or shall it be Spain's for arrogant-torpid,
sham-devotional purposes contrary to every Law?" is
the way Carlyle put the question in his history of Frederick
the Great, and he adds: "The incalculable Yankee
Nation itself, biggest Phenomenon (once thought beautifullest)
of these Ages,&mdash;this too ... lay involved."
</p>
<p>In the middle of the century, while the prolonged struggle
was culminating, privateering as a method of warfare
reached its zenith. The Thurots and De Cocks of
France and the Wrights of England swarmed over the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
seas, gathering fortune and a sort of fame not soon to be
forgotten. They captured thousands of ships&mdash;literally,
and if the truth be told, the French got more ships than
the Wrights did. But during the period preceding the
declaration of open war in 1756 the English privateers
were alone especially active and successful. They brought
in 300 ships manned by 10,000 men, and the ships were
confiscated and the men imprisoned.
</p>
<p>Still more important to this story, however, is the fact
that many Dutch as well as French ships were looted by
the English. While the assaults upon the French were
justified because they avenged similar assaults made by
French privateers, and because enough French sailors to
man a fleet of battleships were thereby sequestered, there
was no such excuse for looting the Dutch. Nevertheless,
by the real standards of international law of that century
(not the avowed standards), these captures were justified
on the ground of necessity in connection with the end for
which the war was waged with such "fierce, deep-breathed
doggedness"&mdash;commercial supremacy. For when war
was raging, the ships of neutral nations were permitted
by ordinary international usage to carry on their commercial
operations unmolested. The Dutch, being neutrals,
gained rapidly in the carrying trade of the world. They
even had hope that they might attain the proud position
they had occupied in the early part of the seventeenth
century. The situation looked ominous to the English.
If they were to retain the supremacy which good fighting

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
in Cromwell's time had given them, it was absolutely necessary
to destroy, or at least check, in some way, the growing
prosperity of the Dutch. It was to this end that English
privateers (even fishermen in open boats, armed with
clubs) were encouraged in looting Dutch merchantmen.
To give color of law to this form of piracy, the "Rule of
1756" was provided. Under this rule, which was merely
a dictum of the English crown, neutral ships were forbidden
to enter any trade in time of war from which they
were commonly excluded in time of peace. For example,
the Dutch were excluded from the trade between France
and the French colonies in time of peace; when war was
declared, the French were glad to have Dutch ships in
the trade, but England declared she would confiscate every
Dutch ship found in it.
</p>
<p>With these facts in mind,&mdash;remembering especially
that in the state of civilization then prevailing, some
forms of piracy were justified by expediency,&mdash;recall
the feeling with which an influential part of the people
of England were coming to regard the colonies.
</p>
<p>"How much I despise them!" wrote Lord Bellomont,
in 1700, when some New England merchants objected
to his seizure, confessedly contrary to law, of a cargo of
timber. In 1724 the master ship-builders of the Thames
united in a formal complaint to the king, in which they
said, truthfully, that their trade was depressed and their
workmen were emigrating because of the competition of
the New England yards. Nor were the ship-builders the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
only ones in England who were depressed by American
competition. The books of Sir Josiah Child were, perhaps,
no longer read, but his warnings were coming to be heeded
more and more, and the contempt which Lord Bellomont
had expressed was well-nigh universal among the nobility.
</p>
<p>As the reader remembers, the petition of the Thames
ship-builders was not granted. As late as 1739 Walpole
said:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"It has been a maxim with me to <i>encourage</i> the trade
of the American colonies <i>in the utmost latitude</i>. Nay,
it has been necessary to pass over some irregularities."
</p>
<p>That was a most important statement. In 1739 Walpole
encouraged the trade of the Americans in the utmost
latitude. With inconsiderable exceptions as to time and
conditions, the Americans had been, in fact, encouraged in
the utmost latitude during nearly 100 years. Even a tax
laid on foreign molasses, at the request of the English
West Indies, in 1733, had been as dead as the navigation
laws of Charles II.
</p>
<p>But when the privateers of England were loosed to prey
upon neutral ships as well as on those of the enemy, the
navigation laws were suddenly revived. The privateers
found, in the colonial evasions of these laws, golden opportunities
to secure plunder, for colonial ships were constantly
evading the laws, and the penalty for doing so
was confiscation in favor of the informer. Naturally the
English privateers seized the colony ships all the more
eagerly because of England's growing jealousy of American

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
shipping. The rôle of these piratical privateers as guardians
of the law was supported by courts of admiralty
which were composed of judges who received fees that
were increased by every condemnation.
</p>
<p>For the sake of emphasis let the facts be repeated.
After a period of nearly 100 years, during which such
leaders as Walpole had "encouraged" American ship-owners
"in the utmost latitude," a horde of pirates and
corrupt judges resurrected the law; and when a valuable
prize was in question, they even disregarded the law they
pleaded, as well as justice, to condemn her. And there
was no redress.
</p>
<p>Of the acts of the British government in connection with
the Stamp Act, the duty on tea, and the other efforts to
tax the American colonists contrary to their constitutional
rights as British citizens, nothing need be said here except
to remind the reader that ships of the royal navy were
commissioned as revenue cutters and stationed on the
American coast (1764), from Casco Bay to Cape Henlopen.
</p>
<p>To illustrate the conditions that prevailed thereafter
until the War of the Revolution, here is a brief account
of the events in Rhode Island waters that led to the destruction
of the British naval revenue cutter <i>Gaspé</i>.
</p>
<p>The schooner <i>St. John</i>, Lieutenant Hill commanding,
was the first of the naval fleet stationed in Rhode Island
waters. It was the duty of Lieutenant Hill to examine
every vessel trading in those waters to learn whether she
were violating the laws. A brig that had discharged cargo

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
at Howland's Ferry was suspected of being a smuggler, but
she was not molested until she had gone to sea. Then
she was followed, brought back, and found to be entirely
innocent. If examined before sailing, no injury to
her owners would have resulted, but to bring her back
when well under way, and that, too, at the whim of a
supercilious naval officer, not only caused loss but roused
indignation. A mob of Newport people gathered to attack
the schooner, but they were prevented doing so by the
arrival of another man-o'-war in the harbor.
</p>
<p>While the people were yet fretted by the needless interference
with the brig, the man-o'-war <i>Maidstone</i> came to
port, and began impressing seamen from the merchant
ships in the bay, and finally took the entire crew from a
ship just home from the year-long voyage to the coast of
Africa. It seems impossible, now, that a naval officer
should be guilty of such needless cruelty as taking men
under such circumstances, but the truth is that the naval
officers of that period found pleasure in cruelty. It
was because of inhumanity&mdash;the harshness with which
men were treated in the navy&mdash;that impressment was
necessary. The friends and relatives of the impressed
seamen were unable to obtain redress, but they expressed
their feelings by burning one of the <i>Maidstone's</i> small
boats.
</p>
<p>In 1769 Captain William Reid, commanding the
war-sloop <i>Liberty</i>, seized a merchant brig on Long Island
Sound and brought her to Newport, where, although it

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
was found that she was not, and had not been, violating
the law in any way, she was held for several days. And
when the captain of the brig went to the <i>Liberty</i> in an effort
to secure release, and, on failing, expressed his indignation
in sailor language, a number of muskets were fired
at him. To avenge this indignity, a mob boarded the
<i>Liberty</i> that night, cut away her mast, threw her guns
overboard, and when she drifted ashore on Goat Island,
burned her.
</p>
<p>Finally the <i>Gaspé</i>, commanded by Lieutenant William
Dudingston, came to the bay. Dudingston thought that
every innocent colonial vessel in those waters ought to
be subjected to every inconvenience rather than let one
smuggler escape. In fact, the naval officers on the coast
had all come to the opinion that all colonists were criminals,
as well as of the lowest class of people in the social scale,
and that it was a duty to inflict punishment upon them
whenever possible.
</p>
<p>In this frame of mind Dudingston stopped everything
afloat, including the open boats carrying farm produce
across the bay; threw here and there the cargoes, regardless
of the losses thus created; looted some of the produce, and
finally seized a sloop (<i>Fortune</i>), carrying twelve hogsheads
of rum, and sent her to the Court of Admiralty at
Boston, although the law expressly provided that vessels
seized in Rhode Island waters should be tried by the Rhode
Island court.
</p>
<p>"I was not ignorant of the statute to the contrary,"

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
wrote Dudingston to Admiral Montegue. He violated
the law because he supposed the Massachusetts court
would be more likely to condemn the sloop. The zeal
of the lieutenant was highly commended by the admiral.
</p>
<p>Having thus roused the indignation of every American
living in the region, Dudingston went in chase of the packet
sloop <i>Hannah</i>, in her passage from Newport to Providence,
on the memorable 8th of June, 1772. The <i>Hannah</i> was
called a packet because she plied regularly on one route.
She had fully complied with the laws before leaving Newport,
but Dudingston stopped everything, as said, and he
now tried to bring-to the <i>Hannah</i>, but Captain Lindsey,
commanding her, held his course. She had sailed at
noon with a fair tide, but Lindsey knew that she would
have the tide against her for two hours, at best, and he
was not going to spoil the passage by stopping, and thus
losing what tide was coming his way. Indignant at this lack
of respect for one of the king's naval officers, Lieutenant
Dudingston made all sail in chase, and followed the <i>Hannah</i>
until she tacked across what was called Namquit (now
Gaspee) point, when, in trying to follow her, the <i>Gaspé</i>
grounded.
</p>
<p>When Captain Lindsey told his story in Providence, a
drummer paraded the streets, gathering recruits, and
enough men assembled to fill eight "long boats," the
largest size of boat carried by merchant ships. Though
these men were going to attack a naval vessel armed with
cannon, they were armed with but few weapons better

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
than clubs and paving-stones. Having disguised themselves
in the garb of Indians, they rowed with muffled oars
to the stranded schooner, shot down the lieutenant with
one of the few muskets carried, clubbed the rest of the
crew into submission, and then burned the schooner.
</p>
<p>The owner of the <i>Hannah</i>, who instigated this attack
upon the king's vessel, was Captain John Brown, the
wealthiest merchant in Providence. The leader of the
expedition was Captain Abraham Whipple, who, as a
privateer, had taken a million dollars' worth of prizes
during the wars with France and Spain. The whole mob,
for a mob it was in the eyes of the law, were representative
citizens not only of Rhode Island but of all the seafaring
people of the colonies. The time had come when Americans
would, in defence of Justice, do more than evade an
unjust law; in burning the <i>Gaspé</i> they were, as Lord
Dartmouth declared, "<i>levying war</i> against the king."

<h2>CHAPTER V
<br />
<span class="s08">MERCHANTMEN IN BATTLE ARRAY</span>
</h2>
<p><span class="b20">S</span>OME of the most stirring tales in the history of the
American merchant marine are those of the battles
of men who, like Captain Jonathan Haraden, of
Salem, commanded armed merchantmen during the War
of the Revolution. These stories are of special interest
here because they portray one side of the character of the
American sailors as developed by the peculiar conditions
where forest life and sea life met at the surf-line. But
before giving any of these tales, it seems necessary to
describe briefly the peculiarities of the ships in use in the
colonies during the eighteenth century.
</p>
<p>While the dictionaries define, fairly well, all sorts of
sea terms, it seems worth noting here that a ship, in the
earliest days of the colonies, had three masts, two of which
were fitted with yards to spread four-sided sails across the
hull, while the third carried a long, slender yard that spread
a lateen sail fore and aft. Moreover, a square sail was
spread by a yard that hung beneath the end of the bowsprit.
Because the lateen sail was difficult to handle,
and the one on the spritsail-yard dipped into the water,
both were soon abolished on the American ships. American

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
sailors were high-priced, economy was necessary, and
rigs that reduced the number of men needed were adopted
perforce.
</p>
<p>The ketch was another rig that did not last long. A
ketch had one mast amidships, with yards crossed upon it,
and another smaller mast well aft, upon which yards were
also crossed, though sometimes a fore-and-aft sail was
found there. It was, doubtless, the worst rig ever seen in
American waters.
</p>
<p>The snow was a modified brig. She had two masts
with yards crossed as in a ship, and in addition had a
slender mast close abaft the main&mdash;a sort of spencer-mast
upon which a fore-and-aft sail was set. This style
of rig lasted much longer than its name, though that
persisted until the nineteenth century.
</p>
<p>The most popular rig, during the first hundred years
of the colonies, was the sloop, and it can still be seen on
oyster boats, brick carriers, and yachts. No other rig
will give a hull as great speed, in proportion to the canvas,
as this one, and yet the rig can be managed by few men,
provided they know their work, and are vigilant. Long
coasting voyages were made with sloops carrying forty
tons of cargo, and no more than four men. Voyages to
the West Indies were made in larger sloops with six men,
while oversea voyages were accomplished with one or two
more.
</p>
<p>In 1713 a contemplation of the advantages of the
sloop rig led Captain Andrew Robinson, of Gloucester,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Mass., to build a hull, somewhat larger than the
ordinary sloop of the day, and place in it two masts,
each of which carried the sloop rig. If rigged as a sloop,
the one sail would need to be so large that it would be
difficult to handle. By dividing the canvas between two
sails <i>of the same form</i>, a great enough spread for speed
would be obtained, and yet neither sail would be larger
than the single one on a smaller hull. The sails were probably
stretched before this vessel was launched, and one
may believe that the novelty of the rig drew a large crowd
to the launching. Beyond doubt, too, everybody cheered
as the hull took the water, and one enthusiast shouted,&mdash;
</p>
<p>"Oh, how she scoons!"
</p>
<p>"Scoon" referred to the light and swift motion of the
hull as it seemed to glide over, rather than plough through,
the water, but Captain Robinson, who had been wondering
what he would name the curious rig, seized upon the word
"scoon" and said, "A scooner let her be!"
</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important event in the shipyards of
America, previous to the launching of Fulton's steamer,
was the invention of the schooner. For under this rig a
hull of twice the capacity of an ordinary sloop could be
handled with no, or but a small, increase in the number of
men. Moreover, the cost of the rig was less than that of
any other for a hull of similar size. In short, a schooner
gave her owner more ton-miles of work than any other
kind of vessel for each dollar of expense. Schooners were
soon used almost exclusively in the cod-fishery on the banks.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
They rapidly made their way into the coasting trade, where
they gathered cargoes for the ships used in the export trade,
and served to strengthen the slender cords binding one part
of the country to the other. They even went on foreign
voyages with great success&mdash;as they might do now, if only
American owners would take what lies before them.
</p>
<p>With the growth of American shipping it was inevitable
that American sailors should go privateering. The love
of adventure was born into the people who lived where salt
spray gave a tang to the odors of a pine forest. Armed
ships from Boston hunted Dutch merchantmen as long as
the Hudson region was called New Amsterdam. American
sailors ate broiled rawhide with Morgan on the banks
of the Chagres River. Kidd came from London to New
York seeking sailors born in the Highlands of the Hudson,
because they were, of all men in the world, best fitted by
experience and natural inclination for the work he had in
hand. Franklin at one time expressed the hope that the
American coast would never shelter such hosts as were
found in Algiers and Tripoli, and the thought was founded
on his knowledge of the eager determination to get on in
life, at all hazards, which the conditions of life in America
had generated.
</p>
<p>The most important era in the apprenticeship of the colonial
merchantmen was that passed in fighting the French
and Spanish during England's long struggle for commercial
supremacy in the eighteenth century, a period during
which New York alone commissioned 48 vessels, carrying

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
675 guns and 5530 men. As affording interesting views of
the work done by the American seamen at that time, consider
some of the incidents of the siege of Louisburg, for
while the siege was a land contest, it was carried on by men
the majority of whom, perhaps, were sailors, and the incidents
to be recalled were, at any rate, peculiarly characteristic
of the New England foremast hand.
</p>
<p>The armed ships numbered thirteen, and ninety merchantmen
were chartered to carry the men. The number
of ships then owned in the colonies at that time is nowhere
stated, but it was not difficult to gather this fleet in New
England.
</p>
<p>Although the heavy masonry forts at Louisburg mounted
42-pounders, the heaviest guns the fleet carried were 22-pounders;
but 42-pounder shot were cast for the expedition,
and taken along, because every man in the fleet was
entirely confident that 42-pounders would soon be captured
from the enemy.
</p>
<p>Having landed about two miles from the main fortification
(April 30, 1745), one William Vaughan, "a youth of
restless and impetuous activity," led 400 men "to the hills
near the town and saluted it with three cheers." On
May 2 this same impetuous youth, while wandering around
with a squad of twelve men and boys, reached a number
of unguarded storehouses belonging to the enemy. They
were so far from the main scene of activity of the colonists
that the French, apparently, had not thought it worth while
to guard them. Vaughan set them on fire, and the conflagration

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
frightened the soldiers in a large detached fort so much
that they fled. A little later Vaughan and his gang took
possession of the abandoned fort, and while a boy of eighteen
years climbed the flagstaff and spread a red coat to the
breeze in place of a flag, another one ran to the colonial
general (Pepperrell) with this message from Vaughan:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"May it please your Honour to be informed that by the
grace of God and the courage of thirteen men, I entered
the Royal Battery about 9 o'clock, and am waiting for a
reinforcement and a flag."
</p>
<p>The 42-pounders for which shot had been cast in
Boston were secured&mdash;twenty-eight of them, besides two
18-pounders.
</p>
<p>When the siege guns were landed from the transports,
and an effort was made to take them forward across a wide
swamp, in order to mount them where they would reach
the town, they sank out of sight in the mud. Thereupon
the men made a broad-runner sled for each gun, harnessed
themselves to the sleds, and waded across the swamp, dragging
the guns after them. That feat has excited the admiration
of all historians who have written about it. But
these men had built ships a mile from the water&mdash;back in
the woods&mdash;and, when each was ready for the sea had
dragged it to the beach with many yoke of oxen; dragging
cannon across the swamp was a small matter in their
estimation.
</p>
<p>A trained engineer wanted them to advance upon the big
fort of the enemy in the usual scientific manner&mdash;by digging

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
parallels, one after another, and covering every step
of the advance with earthworks. The proposal made
them laugh. Taking advantage of a foggy night, they went
forward, rolling sugar hogsheads, brought for the purpose,
before them, until they arrived at the most advanced point
desirable, and there they up-ended the hogsheads, filled
them with dirt, mounted their siege guns (including 42-pounders
taken from the royal fort), and opened fire.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile they were without tents; their clothing and
shoes wore out under the excessive abrading of their work;
they were soaked by cold rains, but shelters of evergreen
boughs were erected, and "while the cannon bellowed in
front ... the men raced, wrestled, pitched quoits, fired
at marks," and "ran after the French cannon balls that
sometimes fell in the camp" where "frolic and confusion
reigned" perpetually.
</p>
<p>The capture of Louisburg had small effect upon the
country, but the work of the besiegers, rightly seen, was of
the most important ever done in the colonies. Throughout
the siege they were inspired by the idea that "the All
of Things is an infinite conjugation of the verb <i>To Do</i>";
they took hold of each task with hearty good-will, and were
irrepressible; their rude disregard for convention gave
opportunity to their resourcefulness, and contributed to
the evolution of military science. And lessons learned before
Louisburg were applied at Bunker Hill, and elsewhere,
during the Revolution.
</p>
<p>Among the heroes of the privateer ships of the Revolution

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
we may well recall Captain Jonathan Haraden, as a
type. In 1780 he sailed from Salem in the 180-ton ship
<i>Pickering</i>, armed with fourteen 6-pounders, manned by
about fifty men, all told, bound to Bilboa with a cargo
of sugar. At this period of the war the British, taught by
experience, had sent out fleets of frigates and sloops of war,
besides many brigs, cutters, and privateers of large size in
order to suppress the armed ships of the "rebels." On the
way across, Haraden met a heavy cutter and beat her off.
While reaching across the Bay of Biscay, one night, he
overhauled a ship the lookouts of which appeared to be
asleep; for there was no stir upon her deck until Haraden
hailed and ordered her to surrender, saying that his ship
was an American frigate and he intended firing a broadside
immediately. The sleepy captain obeyed the order. It
was then learned that she was a privateer much superior
to the <i>Pickering</i> in the number of guns and of men. On
arriving off Bilboa a big armed ship was seen coming out,
and the captured captain told Haraden she was the privateer
<i>Achilles</i>, mounting forty-two guns and manned by 140
men.
</p>
<p>"I shan't run from her," said Haraden, quietly.
</p>
<p>The <i>Achilles</i> took possession of the privateer captured
in the Bay of Biscay, but because it was a calm night, and
the <i>Pickering</i> would be unable to escape, the captain of
the <i>Achilles</i> determined to wait until morning before
attacking. On seeing this, Haraden arranged a proper
lookout and then went to sleep.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
At dawn, when the <i>Achilles</i> came down ready for battle,
the <i>Pickering</i> was lying so far inshore that a throng of
people, supposed to number 100,000, gathered on the hills
to watch the contest, and they found the spectacle worth
the trouble taken. Calling his men to the mast, Haraden
assured them that they would win in spite of the greater
force of the enemy, and then ordered them to "Take particular
aim at the white boot top."
</p>
<p>Inspired by the air of confidence with which the captain
had addressed them, the men returned to quarters. Their
ship was loaded down so far in the water that she "appeared
little larger than a long boat" when the <i>Achilles</i>
ranged alongside, but, as <i>Captain Haraden had foreseen</i>,
the difference in height gave him a decisive advantage.
</p>
<p>The <i>Achilles</i>, with her great battery and numerous crew,
opened a fire that seemed overwhelming. But at that
time (and for years afterward) English sailors relied upon
speed of fire only to win their battles; the guns of the
<i>Achilles</i> were discharged without aiming, and because the
gun deck was far above the water, nearly every shot
passed over the <i>Pickering</i>. But the American gunners
were half sailor, half backwoodsmen; they took particular
aim at the white boot top of the <i>Achilles</i>, and drove so
many shot through her side near the water-line that, after
about three hours of fighting, the British captain found
that he would have to haul off or sink. He decided to
fly. Then, on seeing the British sailors running to the
braces to swing the yards, Haraden ordered his gunners

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
to load with crowbars, hoping to cut the rigging of the
<i>Achilles</i> with these curious projectiles, and thus keep her
from running away; but "she had a mainsail as large as
a ship of the line," and when that sail began to draw she
escaped.
</p>
<p>As the <i>Pickering</i> and her recaptured prize came to anchor
in the bay, the enthusiastic spectators of the battle
flocked off in such numbers that at one time it would have
been possible to build with the boats around her a pontoon
bridge reaching from ship to shore.
</p>
<p>When Captain William Gray was a lieutenant on the
privateer <i>Jack</i>, she was attacked by one of the enemy of
such superior force that she was soon disabled. Thereupon
the enemy came alongside and tried to board. In
heading his men in repelling the attack, Gray was struck
by a bayoneted musket which had been pitchpoled at
him. The bayonet pinned him fast to a gun carriage so
that he was unable to get away, but after one of his men
had withdrawn the bayonet, he again attacked the boarders
and they were repelled.
</p>
<p>When Captain John Manly commanded the privateer
<i>Jason</i>, of Boston, he was chased by a British frigate into
a roadstead near the Isle of Shoals. He would have been
captured there but for a friendly squall which, while it
dismasted him, drove away the frigate. At this, however,
Manly's troubles began. He had previously lost the
privateer <i>Cumberland</i>, and his crew decided that the dismasting
was clear proof that he was unlucky. A mutiny

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
followed, but Manly, snatching a cutlass from one of the
crew, attacked the mutineers single-handed, and after
cutting down two of them, set the remainder at work rerigging
the ship; and he kept them at it until she was
ready for sea thirty-six hours later. Finally, he went to
Sandy Hook and captured two big privateers fresh from
that port and very valuable.
</p>
<p>As noted in the <i>Story of the New England Whalers</i>, there
is abundant reason for saying that "out of the 1700 men
who had manned Nantucket whalers before the war, some
hundreds shipped on the privateers. They took kindly
to a calling in which there was such a strong element of
chance. The hope of good luck was strong within them."
When an American privateer was captured by the enemy,
they separated the Nantucket men from the remainder of
the crew, and then by bribery on the one hand, and starvation
and other kinds of ill treatment, on the other, they
forced as many as possible into the English whaleships.
</p>
<p>Many more tales might be related, but the facts here
given show well enough that the men who were at once
woodsmen, ship-builders, fishermen, and sailors could
also fight. It is especially notable that they could usually
think calmly and decide swiftly, as Haraden did. The
conditions under which the American seamen of the
period had been reared had made them, as so frequently
pointed out herein, at once resourceful, enterprising, persistent,
and unafraid.
</p>
<p>The records of the privateers are so few in number that

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
only imperfect estimates can be made of the number and
force of the fleet. The Continental Congress bonded
1699 privateers during the war, but since many ships were
bonded more than once, some under different names, it is
not possible to say how many individual ships were thus
represented. Further than that the colonies commissioned
many vessels that had no commission from the
Congress. Hale, in Winsor's <i>History of America</i>, says
that Massachusetts owned 600 privateers. Salem alone
owned 158. More than 200 were owned in Connecticut,
Rhode Island, and New Hampshire. The fleets of the
Delaware, the Chesapeake, and of Charleston were considerable.
Certainly more than 1000 armed ships were
sent to sea by American owners to seize the merchantmen
of the enemy. The fishing smack <i>Wasp</i>, carrying
9 men and no cannon, was, perhaps, the weakest;<a id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor"><sup>[3]</sup></a> the
<i>Deane</i>, carrying 30 cannon and 210 men, was the most
powerful. There were 40 American privateers of the
force of 20 guns and 100 men or larger.
</p>
<p>American histories have, almost without exception,
glorified these privateers. They note that Dodsley's
<i>Register</i> for 1778 recorded the capture of 733 British ships
by American cruisers, of which 559 were brought into
port. What these prizes sold for is not recorded, but it
appears that the British loss was estimated at £2,600,000.
Gomer Williams, in his history of the Liverpool privateers,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
says that the War of the Revolution put an entire
stop to the commercial progress of that port. It was the
venturesome American privateer who haunted the Irish
channel until the Dublin linen fleet sailed under convoy
to Chester, that thus injured Liverpool. According to
Troughton, another Liverpool historian, "the manners
of the common people" of the town "made a retrogression
towards barbarism." Mr. Hale estimates that 3000 British
ships were captured, and that the losses crippled the
commercial prosperity of England severely.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, however, while the American cruisers
were capturing the 773 British ships, the British cruisers
captured and sent into port 904 American ships, which
brought the captors £2000 each on the average. The
losses of the American owners were, of course, much
larger. Worse yet, the American ships were all eventually
driven from the seas, save only as a few of the largest
and most powerful were able to dodge and outsail the
frigates and sloops-of-war which the British sent in pursuit
of them. Haraden himself, though he captured more
than a thousand guns from the enemy, was at last caught
at St. Eustatia by Admiral Rodney's fleet.
</p>
<p>If the accounts of gains and losses could be posted ledger
fashion, the struck balance would show that while the captured
goods<a id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor"><sup>[4]</sup></a> were at times almost the only resource of the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
colonists needing goods of foreign manufacture, and while,
too, a few individuals were enriched, the losses of the ship
merchants as a class, and of the country, far outweighed
the gains. American independence was not won, as so
often claimed, by the privateers; it was not even forwarded.
</p>
<p>There was a further loss, which, though it cannot be
measured, was real. There is abundant evidence to show
that the successes of the few made gamblers, and even
thieves, of many merchants. While two frigates were on
the stocks in Rhode Island, the timber belonging to the
government was stolen for use in privateers. Still another
evil influence is found in the fact that the magnified stories
of privateer work made the people believe that the greed
of the merchants would serve to defend the new-born
nation from foreign aggression better than a navy could
do it. And not until after the War of 1812 was brought
upon us was the miserable delusion dispelled.
</p>
<p>In two respects only did the privateers serve the American

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
merchant marine well: they gave some thousands of
individual seamen increased ability to handle ships under
difficult conditions, and they improved the speed of the
whole fleet.
</p>
<p>Captain Elias Hasket Derby, of Salem, was perhaps the
first American to make a systematic study of ship models
with a view of increasing speed. He established a shipyard
near his wharf at Salem; with untrammelled mind
he made experiments, and eventually he built 4 ships of
from 300 to 360 tons' burden, each of which became noted
for strength and speed. One of them (the <i>Astræ</i>, a vessel
less than 100 feet long), while on her way to the Baltic,
made the run from Salem to the Irish coast in eleven days.
In 1783 this vessel crossed from Salem to France in 18 days,
and she made the passage home in 19.
</p>
<p>Only a few ships remained in commission to float the
flag of the "new constellation" at the end of the War of
the Revolution, but it was a matter of no small significance
that these ships were, on the average, far superior to those
that had formed the American merchant marine in colonial
days. Indeed, they were literally the best merchantmen
in the world. And the conditions under which they were
to sail, though harrowing to the owners and to all patriotic
Americans, were to maintain the standard of the fleet
for many years to come.

<h2>CHAPTER VI
<br />
<span class="s08">EARLY ENTERPRISE OF THE UNITED STATES MERCHANT
MARINE</span>
</h2>
<p><span class="b20">W</span>HEN the War of the Revolution came to an end,
the territory of the United States extended
along the Atlantic coast from Maine to Georgia,
and westward over the Appalachian Mountains as far as
the Mississippi River. The population, including slaves,
numbered no more than 3,500,000. The settlements have
usually been considered in groups&mdash;those of New England,
of the Middle states, of the Southern states, and, last of
all, that most interesting group west of the mountains.
Virginia, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania were the most
populous states. Philadelphia, the largest city, boasted
a population of 42,520 in the first census year (1790).
New York was second, Boston third, Charleston fourth,
and Baltimore fifth. Newport and Portsmouth, though
small, were yet ports of importance, and so, too, was Salem.
</p>
<p>The interests of the different groups of population of
the country were then supposed to be in some ways antagonistic.
The Southern states produced tobacco, rice, and
indigo for export, and had relatively few ships; wanting

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
low freight rates, they expressed, at times later, the fear of
combinations between owners of ships living elsewhere, by
which rates would be raised. The seeming antagonisms
were magnified by the lack of means of intercourse between
them. While roads wide enough for vehicles had
been cut from town to town near the coast as far south as
Virginia, and a few had been opened into the interior along
the routes of armies during the war, the most comfortable
way of travelling was by water, and ships were the only
means for transporting freight, save only as some goods
were carried on mules and wagons into the interior&mdash;on
one route as far as Pittsburg.
</p>
<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption"><a id="Ill4"></a><span class="smcap">Custom House, Salem</span>
</p>
<p class="caption">From a print in the possession of the Lenox Library
</p>
</div>
<p>On the whole, a bird's-eye view of the United States
showed a wilderness, 820,680 square miles in extent, that
had a line of settlements along the coast. The political
condition of the country was not unlike its physical&mdash;chaotic.
The thirteen colonies, having thrown off allegiance
to the mother-country, had essayed the formation of
a ship of state, but had created only a raft of thirteen logs,
if such a simile may be permitted, which chafed each
other with growing friction. Congress was nominally the
executive, the legislative, and the judicial head of a nation,
but the money it issued ceased to circulate, and the bonds,
representing borrowed coin and war material, were little
better. As a body, the Congress consisted of a score or
so of respectable gentlemen who met in a hall hired for
the purpose, where they expressed their opinions on matters
of international as well as local concern, and then

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
begged the sovereign states to take action. They had no
power <i>to do</i> anything&mdash;not even to raise the money with
which to pay the rent of the hall in which they met.
</p>
<p>An examination of the American merchant marine at
this time shows that it had fallen far below that of the
colonies. In a communication to Congress, 19 ship-builders
of Philadelphia said (1789) that while they had
launched 4500 tons of shipping per year before the war,
"it appears from an average of three years past that
we have built only to the amount of 1500 tons annually."
Similar complaints were made by the shipwrights
of Charleston, Baltimore, and Boston. The Charleston
communication was especial interesting. It said:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"From the diminished state of ship building in America,
and the <i>ruinous restrictions</i> to which our vessels are subject
in <i>foreign ports</i>; from the distressed condition of our commerce,
languishing under the <i>most disgraceful inequalities</i>,
its benefits transferred to strangers ... who <i>neither have
treaties with us</i> ... nor are friendly to our commerce,"
it therefore seemed necessary to ask Congress to consider
what ought to be done in the matter (<i>Am. State Papers</i>,
VII, 9; X, 5-6).
</p>
<p>It will help to a comprehension of the condition of our
merchant marine if we recall once more the feeling of the
English public towards the colonists before the war.
While statesmen like Robert Peel fostered the growth of
American shipping and commerce by encouraging them
in evading the navigation laws, the growth thus fostered

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
roused a strong feeling of ill-will on the part of many
patriotic Englishmen. This feeling was entirely natural
and unavoidable. It was not alone that the Americans
were well able to compete with the mother-country for the
carrying trade of the world. Under the influence of environment
the Americans were developing into a distinct
people. The successful colonial was often and perhaps
usually self-assertive and boastful; he was necessarily
aggressive. Then, too, he showed a lack of deference in
the presence of rank that seemed shocking to the nobility.
Men who were doing the world's work in the American
wilderness made no efforts to conceal their contempt for
royal governors, and the influential part of the people of
England accepted the complaining letters of these baffled
governors as accurate characterizations of the American
people. Because of a sort of race prejudice thus produced,
the measures of the king, when coercion was attempted,
were heartily approved by the majority of the English
people.
</p>
<p>Then, during the war, the expelled American loyalists
had <i>ex parte</i> stories to tell that added indignation to animosity.
The successful American cruisers added to the
ill feeling. At the same time the British authorities observed
a tendency among the foremost hands in the British
navy that was not a little alarming. While their navy
lost, in the years from 1776 to 1780, 19,788 men through
disease and battle, no less than 42,069 deserted. Some
of these deserters were, of course, Americans who had

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
been impressed, but many a good British tar learned
about the opportunities in the new land and made haste
to go to meet them.
</p>
<p>In short, it was through natural and unavoidable causes
that the influential Britons came to regard their "American
cousins" with a feeling of, say, intense animosity not
wholly unmingled with apprehension.
</p>
<p>Keeping in mind this mental attitude, recall the fact that
a command of the sea was then absolutely essential to the
well-being of the British people, and further, that the supremacy
which the British then boasted had been obtained,
and maintained for a century, by good hard fighting; and
further still, that many British thinkers had been alarmed
at such American progress as had been manifested even a
hundred years before the Declaration of Independence.
Bluntly stated, while the British people had learned to
hate the American, they suddenly saw that he alone had
shown an ability to dispute that supremacy upon the sea
which seemed absolutely necessary for the preservation of
their national existence. And as an independent citizen
of the world he was in a position to force the issue. It
follows, therefore, that the British were naturally led to do
all they could to oppose all progress in the United States.
The "ruinous restrictions" of which the Charleston ship-builders
made mention were a natural sequence of the
success of the Revolution.
</p>
<p>While the British were thus hostile upon the sea (they
were also holding American territory in the West, and inciting

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
the Indians to war), the French and the Spanish
were united in an effort to cut off all that part of the United
States west of the Appalachians. For civilization was
then in the primitive state where men, though they talked
about international law, were guided only by unenlightened
selfishness, and acknowledged no other court of
appeal than that afforded by the sword.
</p>
<p>The story of foreign aggressions upon American shipping
and commerce will be told in the next chapter, but
by way of illustrating conditions in the years following the
Revolution, consider one fact regarding the British work
of opposition. All American trade with the British West
Indies was forbidden, and so strictly was this regulation
enforced that thousands of slaves starved to death in those
islands for want of the "refuse fish" and other food which
the planters had been accustomed to obtain from America;
and even some of the poorer white people died for the
same reason.
</p>
<p>Because of ruined industries, and of a chaotic government
at home, and of the ruthless opposition of the nations of
Europe, the condition of the people of the United States
seemed almost hopeless. So great was the depression of
the seafaring part of the population, indeed, that even the
optimistic whalers of Nantucket thought about removing
their industry to France, and many of them did migrate.
</p>
<p>And yet it was in this period of deepest gloom that the
American merchant marine first reached out for the trade
of the Far East. In the <i>Journals of Congress</i> for 1784

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
(p. 333) is a paragraph referring to "a letter of the 23d
December, 1783, from Daniel Parker, stating, that a ship
called the '<i>Empress of China</i>' will shortly sail from New
York for Canton in China, under the command of Captain
John Green, and requesting sea-letters."<a id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
</p>
<p>No commercial ventures to the East Indies were made
in colonial days because, in part, of the monopoly of the
East India Company, but chiefly because abundant profitable
employment for all available capital was found in
various trades nearer home. The fact that ships in the
China trade very often made cent per cent was, of course,
very well known in the colonies, and colonial merchants
had a general knowledge of the cargoes suitable for that
trade. They knew, for instance, that ginseng, a root

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
growing wild in American forests, was highly valued in
China for its supposed medicinal qualities. Accordingly,
when the war ended, and American ships were excluded
from such a large part of the trade which they had enjoyed
in former days, the ship-owners naturally thought of the
trade to the Far East. New York and Philadelphia merchants
united in fitting out a vessel which they renamed
the <i>Empress of China</i>. She measured 360 tons, and the
chief part of her cargo was ginseng. Sailing from New
York on February 22, 1784, with the sea letter noted
above for a passport, she arrived at Canton Roads (Macao)
on August 23, and she reached home on May 11, 1785.
The profit on the venture was $30,000, which, being only
a little more than 25 per cent on the investment, was considered
small. Other voyages of the period are worth
consideration, if only to illustrate the spirit of the ship-owners
of the day.
</p>
<p>The most interesting of the China voyages, in this point
of view, was that of the sloop <i>Experiment</i>, a vessel with
one mast and a capacity for eighty tons of cargo, that was
built at Albany for the trade of the Hudson River. Captain
Stewart Dean, her master, had served in two privateers
during the Revolution. She carried six cannon, with
a liberal supply of small arms, and her crew numbered
fifteen (one account says twenty), men and boys. "Martial
music and the boatswain's whistle were heard on board
with all the pomp and circumstance of war." She carried
out ginseng and brought back tea and silks, with profit;

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
and what is of more importance, perhaps, in this story is
the fact that she made the return voyage in four months
and twelve days. The record shows what a fore-and-aft
rig can do in a round-the-world voyage.
</p>
<p>In the same year a Hingham sloop of only forty tons,
commanded by a Captain Hallett, sailed from Boston,
bound for Canton, but got as far only as the Cape of Good
Hope. At that point English ship captains offered
Captain Hallett two pounds of good tea for each pound of
ginseng he carried, and he was willing to take the profit
thus insured rather than risk a longer voyage in the hope
of a larger one.
</p>
<p>The story of the entrance of Elias Hasket Derby, of
Salem, into the China trade is of interest because of the
view it affords of a peculiarity of most of the successful
ship-owners of the day. Derby considered the possibilities
of the trade as early as any one, but while the
<i>Empress of China</i> was on her way to Canton, Derby sent
his <i>Grand Turk</i> as far as the Cape of Good Hope only.
By trading ginseng and provisions to the English captains
who were found at the Cape, Captain Ingersoll, commanding
the <i>Grand Turk</i>, was able to make a fair profit
on the voyage; but the main object in view was to learn
all about the demands of the Canton trade; and in this
he was entirely successful. It may be worth mentioning
that Captain Ingersoll also went up the coast of Africa to
complete his cargo with gold-dust, ivory, etc., and that
he was under orders not to take on slaves, even though he

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
should thereby be able to make a paying voyage out of a losing
one. Elias Hasket Derby was one of the few individuals
who were far enough ahead of their age to see the iniquity
of the trade, but the important feature of the story of
the voyage is this, that Derby would take the risks of the voyage
to the Cape to obtain information. In the meantime, too,
he sent one of his sons to Europe, where he spent several
months in a study of the India trade of England and France.
</p>
<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption"><a id="Ill5"></a>Elias Hasket Derby
</p>
<p class="caption">From a print in the possession of the Lenox Library
</p>
</div>
<p>With the knowledge thus gained, Captain Derby despatched
the <i>Grand Turk</i> (December 5, 1785) on a voyage
to the Far East, but instead of sailing direct to Canton she
called at the Isle of France (Mauritius); then she went
to the coast of India, and thence to Canton. The trade
at Mauritius and on the Indian coast added greatly to
the profits of the voyage without increasing the length of
time required to a serious extent.
</p>
<p>The trade to China thus initiated was so profitable that
in 1789 no less than fifteen American ships were in the
Canton roads, of which four belonged to Captain Derby.
One of the four is worth especial notice. She was the
swift <i>Astræ</i>, Captain James Magee, Jr., commanding, and
Thomas Handyside Perkins, supercargo. More than
twenty individual ventures were made in this voyage of
the <i>Astræ</i>, and a few notes from her outward manifest
(list of cargo) will serve well to show the course of trade in
those days. Thus Tenney and Brown, of Newbury, sent
"9 kegs snuff," and a note in the margin of the manifest
tells Captain Magee that "⅓ the net proceeds you are to

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
credit E. H. D.'s account for freight&mdash;the other ⅔ to lay
out on account of T. &amp; B. in light goods." Opposite
the item "1 phaeton and harness complete, with saddles
and bridles &amp;c., cased up" is a note saying: "This
belongs to Folger Pope ... the net proceeds is to be
credited to E. H. D.'s account, as friend Derby is to have
the use of the money for freight." David Seas sent
"Boxes containing $15,000, 16 casks ginseng, 5570 lbs.
This at one-fifth for freight." William Cabot sent a box
"containing 21 pieces plate, weight 255 oz. 16 dwts.
12 gr." Rum, wines, beer, fish, flour, "598 firkins butter
32,055 lbs," and spermaceti candles were conspicuous
items in the manifest.
</p>
<p>Some quotations from Derby's letter of instructions
to the captain and supercargo are also interesting.
"Make the best of your way for Batavia, and on your
arrival there you will dispose of such a part of the cargo
as you think may be most for my interest. I think you
had best sell a few casks of the most ordinary ginseng if
you can get one dollar a pound for it. If you find
the price of sugar to be low you will then take into the
ship as much of the best white kind as will floor her,
and fifty thousand weight of coffee, if it is low as we have
heard, ... and fifteen thousand of salt petre, if it is very
low, some nutmegs, and fifty thousand weight of pepper;
this you will store in the fore peak for fear of injuring the
teas. The sugars will save the expense of any stone ballast,
and it will make a floor for the teas &amp;c. at Canton.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
At Batavia you must, if possible, get as much freight for
Canton as will pay half or more of your charges....
You must endeavor to be the first ship with ginseng, for
be assured you will do better alone than you will if there
are three or four ships at Canton at the same time with you."
As another of the Derby ships was to be at Batavia on the
arrival of the <i>Astræ</i>, directions were given for the loading
or the sale of that vessel, according as circumstances seemed
to require, but special stress is laid upon the necessity of
making careful calculations before selling the vessel, in
order to be sure that that course would pay better than
bringing her home full of cargo. It is manifest that Derby
did not care to sell her. "Captain Magee and Mr. Perkins
are to have 5 per cent commission for the sales of the
present cargo, and 2½ per cent on the cargo home, and also
5 per cent on the profit made on goods that may be purchased
at Batavia and sold at Canton, or in any other similar
case that may arise on the voyage. They are to have
one-half the passage money&mdash;the other half belongs to
the ship. The privilege of Capt. Magee is 5 percent of
what the ship carries on cargo exclusive of adventures.
The property of Mr. Perkins, it is understood, is to be on
freight, which is to be paid for like other freighters. It is
orders that the ship's books shall be open to the inspection
of the mates and doctor of the ship, so they may know the
whole business" in case of the death of captain or supercargo.
"The Philadelphia beer is put up so strong that
it will not be approved until it is made weaker; you had

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
best try some of it.... The iron is English weight; ...
there is four percent you will gain if sold Dutch weight....
You are not to pay any moneys to the crew while
absent from home, unless in case of real necessity, and then
they must allow an advance for the money.... It is
likewise my order that in case of your sickness that you
write a clause at the foot of these orders putting the command
of the ship into the person's hands that you think
the most equal to it, not having any regard to the station
he at present has in the ship.... Lay out for my account
fifteen or twenty pounds sterling in curiosities."
</p>
<p>The sale of the <i>Astræ</i> is forbidden for this voyage, but "if
at Batavia or Canton you can agree to deliver her the next
season for $20,000 or $25,000 you may do it." The final
paragraph says that while the orders are "a little particular"
"you have leave to break them in any part where
you <i>by calculation</i> think it for my interest."
</p>
<p>As there were fifteen American ships at Canton when
the <i>Astræ</i> was there, the market was flooded with American
goods. Her ginseng sold for $20,000 less than prime cost.
Two of Derby's ships were sold; the other two brought
home 728,871 pounds of tea. Although the consumption
of the country at that time was only about a million pounds
a year, the total imports of the year amounted to 2,601,852
pounds. In the meantime the government had been
organized under the Constitution and a duty levied on imports
which, in the case of the <i>Astræ</i>, amounted to about
$27,000. On the face of the documents the voyage of the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Astræ was disastrous. But Derby, by petition, obtained
the privilege of putting his goods in the warehouse and paying
the duty as they were sold and removed. The system
of bonded warehouses became common later. And according
to the biography of Captain Derby, published in
<i>Hunt's Merchants' Magazine</i>, his capital was not impaired
seriously, if at all, by the voyage.
</p>
<p>Another merchant who reached out for trade in strange
seas was Captain Ebenezer Parsons, who sent ships to the
Red Sea, took on cargoes of coffee for Smyrna, and cleared,
in some voyages, from 300 to 400 per cent. A still larger
profit was made by Captain Jonathan Carnes, of Salem, in
a number of ventures to Sumatra. While at Bencoolen,
on that island, he learned by accident that pepper grew
wild on its uncivilized northwest coast. Returning to
Salem, Carnes imparted his information to Jonathan Peele,
who at once furnished the money with which a schooner
named the <i>Rajah</i> was built. Carnes armed the <i>Rajah</i>
with four guns, shipped a crew of ten men, loaded her with
brandy, gin, tobacco, bar iron, and dried fish, and then, in
November, 1795, cleared out for the East Indies. These
proceedings aroused the greatest curiosity in Boston as well
as Salem; for neither owner nor captain would say a word
about the destination of the schooner; and this curiosity
grew, as the months passed and nothing was heard from
the <i>Rajah</i>. Accordingly, when, after eighteen months,
the schooner came sailing into port loaded to the hatch
coamings with pepper, she created more excitement in

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Salem than any other vessel that entered the port that year.
The profit on this voyage amounted to 700 per cent. When
the <i>Rajah</i> was fitted for a second voyage in the same
secret manner, a number of merchants sent other vessels
in chase, hoping to find where she obtained her pepper; but
Captain Carnes eluded them all, and once more brought
home a cargo at an immense profit. In the third voyage,
however, his secret buying place was discovered, and thereafter
he had to be contented with the ordinary cent per
cent.
</p>
<p>One of the most celebrated voyages of the period was
that of the ship <i>Columbia</i>, Captain John Kendrick, with
the sloop <i>Washington</i>, Captain Robert Gray, as a tender,
to the northwest coast of the continent to trade for furs.
</p>
<p>The <i>Columbia</i> was a ship of 240 tons' burden. She
could just carry the cargo of an Erie canal boat of the size
in use in 1909. The expedition was fitted out by Joseph
Barrell and four others. It sailed on October 1, 1787, and
arrived at Nootka Sound in September, 1788. On July 3,
1789, Captain Gray sailed for home in the Columbia;
and, returning by the way of China and the Cape of Good
Hope, was the first to sail around the world under the
American flag. The work done by these two captains is
chiefly of interest here, however, because of the discoveries
made on the coast and of the use the nation made of
the discoveries later. For the Strait of Juan de Fuca and
adjoining waters were thoroughly explored, the Columbia
River was discovered, and its navigable waters were explored.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Land was purchased of the Indians, forts were
built, and a vessel called the <i>Adventurer</i> (of 40 tons'
burden) was launched. The claim thus established by
American citizens was used with effect, when it had been
made good by subsequent occupation of the land, in settling
the boundary between the United States and the
British possessions to the north thereof.
</p>
<p>The trade on the northwest coast was continued by
Boston people with varying results until after the War of
1812, and many interesting stories have been related by
those engaged in it. John Ledyard, the American traveller,
was first to suggest engaging in it. He was with Captain
Cook, when that celebrated explorer was on the northwest
coast, and learned that the sea-otter skins, which the
Indians had in abundance, could be sold for $120 each in
China. On returning home, he almost succeeded in getting
Robert Morris to enter the trade, but nothing was done in
it until the <i>Columbia</i> sailed.
</p>
<p>The voyage of the <i>Columbia</i> did not pay her owners,
but those who followed her often made large profits. Perhaps
the most interesting venture was one made by William
Sturgis. While trading with the Indians (blankets,
cutlery, firearms, molasses, and trinkets were then in demand),
he learned that the Indians used the skin of the
ermine in its winter coat as a currency, and that it was
highly valued. Accordingly, Sturgis sent home a fine
specimen of the ermine skin, and ordered as many as could
be obtained. His correspondent secured 5000 at the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Leipsic fair, and on the next voyage Sturgis carried them
to the coast, where he traded five, which had been purchased
for thirty cents each, for a sea-otter skin. He thus obtained
a thousand sea-otter skins, which he sold in China
for $50 each, or $50,000 for that part of the venture alone.
Mr. Sturgis, in a lecture delivered in Boston, on January 21,
1846, said that he had known of a capital of $40,000 yielding
a return of $150,000 in that trade, and in one voyage
"an outfit not exceeding $50,000 gave a gross return of
$284,000."
</p>
<p>In the meantime Captain Derby's young supercargo
on the <i>Astræ</i>, Thomas H. Perkins, had established a trading
house in Canton. He entered the northwest coast trade
with success, and in the course of twenty-two years his ships
made thirty round-the-world voyages from Boston, by the
way of the Horn, the northwest coast, Canton, and the Cape
of Good Hope. It is an interesting fact that in the years
immediately following the War of 1812 "all the supplies
for the British [fur-buying] establishments, west of the
Rocky Mountains, were brought from London to Boston,
and carried thence to the mouth of the Columbia in American
ships; and all their collections of furs were sent to
Canton consigned to an American house, and the proceeds
shipped to England or the United States in the same vessels."
(<i>Hunt's Magazine</i>, XIV, 538.)
</p>
<p>In connection with the stories that have been told of these
voyages to the Far East, consider the following facts in the
biography of Captain Nathaniel Silsbee:&mdash;
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
"Among the officers who rose most rapidly to distinction
in the service of Mr. Derby, none is more prominent than
the Hon. Nathaniel Silsbee, late Senator from Massachusetts.
His father had enjoyed the entire confidence of
Mr. Derby, and after his death Mr. Derby transferred that
confidence to his son.
</p>
<p>"In 1790 he appears as the mate and captain's clerk of
a small vessel bound to Madeira. In 1792 [when but
nineteen years old] he is master of a sloop in the trade to
the West Indies, which Mr. Derby impowers him to sell for
$350. In 1793, at the early age of twenty years, he is on a
voyage to the Isle of France in command of the new ship
<i>Benjamin</i>, of 142 tons. From the Isle of France he proceeds
to the Cape of Good Hope, returns to the Isle of
France, and brings his ship home with large profits.
</p>
<p>"In 1796 Mr. Derby dispatches him in the ship <i>Benjamin</i>
to Amsterdam and thence to the Isle of France, with
a credit of $10,000 for his own private adventure. After
selling his ship and cargo at a great profit he purchases a
new ship of 450 tons for his owner and returns to Salem with
a full cargo of East India goods for his owner, and such
favorable results for himself as to enable him to commence
business on his own account, in which he soon achieved
fortune."
</p>
<p>When Silsbee, at the age of twenty, was master of the
<i>Benjamin</i>, on the way to the Isle of France, his first mate,
Charles Derby, was nineteen years old, and his second
mate, Richard J. Cleveland, was only eighteen. In 1799

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
this Cleveland made a voyage in a fifty-foot sloop from
Canton to the northwest coast of America, and, though
hampered by a mutinous crew, he secured there a cargo
of furs which sold, on his return to Canton, for $60,000.
The outfit had cost him $9000.
</p>
<p>Although all ships of the day were, by modern standards,
dangerous in size and rig; though scurvy was the plague
of crews in long voyages; though vast breadths of the sea
had never been explored, and the wild coasts visited had
never been charted; although the first voyages were made
when the American people were financially prostrate and
the symbol of the American government was utterly powerless,
not only in home affairs but in the face of the open and
covert enmity of the leading commercial nations of the
world,&mdash;in spite of all this, the American ship-owners
reached out for the commerce of all the earth, and <i>young
men having ambition and ability worked their way to the
command of ships before they were old enough to vote</i>.
</p>
<p>The picture of one of those boyish sea-captains flinging
the Stars and Stripes to the breeze on the far side of the
earth portrays, better than anything ever said, written, or
done, the spirit of America.

<h2>CHAPTER VII
<br />
<span class="s08">FRENCH AND OTHER SPOLIATIONS</span>
</h2>
<p><span class="b20">O</span>N July 25, 1785, while the schooner <i>Maria</i>, Captain
Isaac Stevens, of Boston, was sailing past Cape
St. Vincent, on the southwest corner of Spain, she
was captured by an armed ship from Algiers, and carried
to that port. Five days later the ship <i>Dauphin</i>, Captain
Richard O'Brien, of Philadelphia, when fifty leagues west
of Lisbon, suffered a similar fate. These vessels with their
cargoes were confiscated, and the crews, numbering twenty-one
men all told, were sold into slavery.
</p>
<p>In connection with these facts consider a quotation from
Lord Sheffield's <i>Observations on the Commerce of the
United States</i>, published in 1784;&mdash;
</p>
<p>"It is not probable that the American States will have
a very free trade in the Mediterranean; it will not be the
interest of any of the great maritime powers to protect
them from the Barbary states. They cannot protect
themselves from the latter; they cannot pretend to a
navy."
</p>
<p>It will now be instructive to recall a letter written by
Edward Church, American consul at Lisbon, on October

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
12, 1793, in regard to the Algerine pirates. Portugal had
been protecting her trade from the Algerines by means of
war-ships, and had incidentally afforded convoy to such
American merchantmen as needed it in those waters.
Having learned that a number of Algerine corsairs had gone
cruising in the Atlantic, Consul Church went to the Portuguese
Minister of Foreign Affairs to learn why the Portuguese
war-ships had allowed them to leave the Mediterranean.
The minister replied that Charles Logie, British
consul at Algiers, acting under orders from the British government,
had <i>concluded</i> a treaty of peace between Algiers
and Portugal. Portugal, he said, had not authorized such
a treaty, nor had she been consulted as to the terms. The
British government had guaranteed the execution of the
treaty, and the payment of the tribute that it called for,
however, and with the British to aid them the pirates had
gone forth to prey on commerce. Church, with more attention
to accuracy than diplomatic language, termed the
arrangement thus made a "hellish conspiracy" against
American shipping.
</p>
<p>A brief account of the Algerine pirates will now prove
interesting. For time out of mind the people of the north
coast of Africa lived by piracy, but it was not until the seafaring
outlaws of Europe taught them to build and handle
large ships that they became really menacing to commerce.
While the English were fighting the Dutch in the middle
of the seventeenth century, they were obliged to send
Blake with twenty-five well-armed ships to overawe these

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
pirates. In 1672 another squadron was sent for the same
purpose. These two squadrons proved that it was easy
and inexpensive to crush the power of the pirates; but instead
of continuing to use their navy to protect their
merchantmen, the British made no further attacks upon
the pirates until 1816. Indeed, instead of crushing their
power, the British government adopted the policy of adding
to their means of destroying commerce. And in this
policy several European powers soon joined.
</p>
<p>Secretary of State Jefferson, in a report on "Mediterranean
Trade," dated December 30, 1790, said that Spain
paid "from three to five million dollars to Algiers" in one
lump to induce the Dey to make "peace." France in 1788
had paid an unknown sum in hand, and had since paid
an annual subsidy of $100,000 for immunity from attack.
Great Britain paid an annual subsidy of 60,000 guineas to
the four Barbary powers. Portugal alone of the European
maritime powers used her fleet to protect her trade. In
addition to the regular subsidies, the powers named made
presents to the Barbary chiefs, and these presents included
usually, if not always, armed ships and other war material.
</p>
<p>The reason for paying subsidies instead of fighting is
most interesting. It was done to encourage the pirates to
ravage the shipping belonging to the rivals of the subsidy
payers.
</p>
<p>In 1793 England was at war with France. America
was the leading neutral maritime nation. The British
statesmen saw that the American shipping would secure

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
much of the trade in the Mediterranean which English
ships had been doing, unless checked promptly by some
extraordinary means, and it was to administer this check
that the pirates were loosed upon the Atlantic.
</p>
<p>The injury done to our shipping in the raid mentioned
above was insignificant, save only as the story gives emphasis
to the other facts given&mdash;facts which show the state of
civilization among the most enlightened nations of Europe.
The state of American civilization, at the time, is shown
by the treaty made with the pirates, under which we
agreed to pay them tribute; for it was tribute and not subsidy
as in our case. We paid it in war material, too, as
shown by the following extract from the <i>Life of General
William Eaton</i>, who, in 1798, was American consul at
Tunis:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"On the 22d of December Mr. Eaton ... went on
board the U. S. brig <i>Sophia</i>, Capt. Henry Geddes, commander,
bound to Algiers; in company with the <i>Hero</i>,
a ship of 350 tons burden, loaded with naval stores for the
Dey of Algiers; the <i>Hassan Bashaw</i>, an armed brig of 275
tons, mounting eight 6-pounders, destined to Algiers; the
<i>Skjoldabrand</i>, a schooner of 250 tons, 16 double fortified
4-pounders, destined to Algiers; and the <i>La Eisha</i>, of 150
tons, 14 4-pounders, also destined to Algiers. All these
vessels excepting the <i>Sophia</i> were to be delivered to the Dey
of Algiers, for arrearages of stipulation and present dues."
</p>
<p>With these facts in mind we shall be able to comprehend
why American shipping was subjected to ruthless spoliations

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
during the entire period between the end of the War
of the Revolution and our second war for liberty, which we
began in 1812. The sole criterion of right in international
affairs was might.
</p>
<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption"><a id="Ill6"></a><span class="smcap">An Early Type of Clipper Ship: <i>Maria</i>, of New Bedford,
Built 1782</span>
</p>
</div>
<p>As the reader remembers, the French spoliations grew
out of the anarchy prevailing during the French Revolution.
To appreciate the facts, one needs to put himself in the place
of the French people and feel not only their aspirations but
their blinding indignation. A well-meaning, most energetic,
and (more or less) hysterical National Convention
displaced an impotent monarchy. "Of the 11,210 decrees
passed by the Convention one-third have a political aim,
two-thirds have a humanitarian aim." (Hugo, in <i>Ninety-Three</i>.)
The surrounding nations, alarmed lest republican
principles gain headway among the "common people,"
formed a coalition to avenge the death of the French king
and destroy the French Republic. England, without
declaring war, held in her ports all merchantmen (including
neutrals) bound for France, and then began to capture
and send into port all neutral ships found at sea with cargoes
of food for French consignees. It was then that
France began to strike back in a way that affected American
shipping. In March and April, 1793, our Minister at Paris
had to complain of several ships captured by French
privateers, and in one of his letters to the French Minister
of Foreign Affairs he said:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"I avoid troubling you with the afflicting recital of the
violences committed on those different occasions, and

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
which were so much the less excusable inasmuch as they
took place after the prizes were taken possession of, and
when no resistence was met with."
</p>
<p>On May 9, 1793, the French government authorized the
seizure of "all neutral vessels which shall be laden wholly or
in part" with food products and "destined for an enemy's
port."
</p>
<p>The decree was contrary to the treaties made between
France and the United States in 1778, but it was confirmed
on the 27th of July.
</p>
<p>This decree was avowedly made because food was scarce
in France and because England was trying to starve the
French into submission by stopping all food-laden ships
bound for France. In the French view it was justified as a
measure of necessity.
</p>
<p>On July 2, 1796, however, it was decreed that "the
flag of the French Republic will treat neutral vessels either
as to confiscation, as to searches or capture in the same
manner as they shall suffer the English to treat them."
</p>
<p>In the meantime the United States had made, under
duress, a treaty with England (Jay's, 1794), which gave
the English advantages of which the French, though by
treaty our allies, were deprived; and this treaty was ratified
in spite of the fact that the British aggressions had exceeded
the French not only in extent, but in their aggravating
character. Moreover, this treaty was not promulgated
until May 9, 1796, and France justly complained of the
concealment as disingenuous. It was partly because of

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the resentment thus created that the decree of July 2, 1796
was made, and it was wholly because of resentment that,
on March 2, 1797, a decree was issued declaring that "every
American vessel shall be a good prize which has not on
board a list of the crew in proper form, such as is presented
by the model annexed to the treaty of the 6th February,
1778."
</p>
<p>No American vessel had carried this <i>rôle d'equipage</i>
since the end of the War of the Revolution; the decree
was passed with the intention of driving all American ships
from the sea. Then, as a final thrust at America, it was decreed
that, October 29, 1799, American sailors found serving
on the ships of enemies should be treated as pirates, and that
they should not be allowed to plead in extenuation that
they had been impressed.
</p>
<p>The following stories of French aggressions illustrate
well the usual course of life at sea in American ships
during the period under consideration:&mdash;
</p>
<p>In 1796 the French privateer <i>Flying Fish</i> came to Philadelphia,
purchased supplies, and made repairs. In the
meantime her captain, aided by the French consul, obtained
information about all the ships then loading with
valuable cargoes for foreign ports. With these facts in
hand the captain then went to the Capes of the Delaware,
waited until one of the most valuable of the American
ships passed out to sea, and then captured her and turned
her crew adrift in a small boat.
</p>
<p>In the same year, while the American ship <i>Hare</i> was

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
lying in London, with a valuable cargo on board, her captain
went to Paris and arranged with the French Minister
of Marine to bring her into French waters and have her condemned
as a prize to him as captor. And this bargain was
carried out.
</p>
<p>Some Philadelphia merchants fitted out a vessel named
<i>Les Jumeaux</i> as a French privateer. When going to sea
she drove off a revenue cutter that tried to stop her, and she
finally made a prize of a vessel belonging to neighbors of
her owner.
</p>
<p>The brigantine <i>Patty</i>, Captain Josiah Hempsted, belonging
to Justus Riley, of Wethersfield, Connecticut, was
captured while on her way to St. Bartholomew, on July 31,
1796. When Captain Hempsted appeared before the
"special agent" (a sort of governor and judge in admiralty)
ruling at Guadaloupe, that official shook his fist under the
captain's nose, and said:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"I have confiscated your vessel and cargo, you damned
rascal."
</p>
<p>The French frigate <i>Thetis</i>, having captured the brigantine
<i>Eliza</i>, of New York, a seaman named Henry Doughty,
a native-born citizen of Boston, was placed with a number
of English sailors who had been captured, and was then delivered
to the British in exchange for French sailors. Using
American sailors in effecting exchanges became a common
practice with the French naval commanders.
</p>
<p>The crews of American vessels taken to the West Indies
were commonly turned ashore without clothing (except

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
what they were wearing), or food, or means of procuring
either. On November 10, 1797, seven captured American
vessels were lying at Petit Guave, three-fourths of the
crews of which had died because of the hardships they had
suffered when thus turned ashore. In some cases the
crews were imprisoned. Captain Breard, of the schooner
<i>Zephyr</i>, of Portsmouth, who ventured to go on board the
privateer that had captured him and there beg for a little
of the food of which he had been robbed, was thrown over
the rail. Captain Codwise, of the brig <i>Glasgow</i>, was
thrown into prison at Leogane and kept for thirty-six hours
without food.
</p>
<p>A more cheerful picture of the life at sea in American
ships at that time is found in a letter (written in 1799) from
Captain Elias Hasket Derby, Jr., to his father. The young
man was in command of the Salem ship <i>Mount Vernon</i>, and
he had arrived at Gibraltar after a passage of seventeen
and a half days.
</p>
<p>"The first of our passage was quite agreeable; the latter,
light winds, calm, and Frenchmen constantly in sight for
the last four days. The first Frenchmen we saw was off
Tercira&mdash;a lugger to the southward. Being uncertain of
his force we stood by him to leeward on our course and soon
left him. July 28th, in the afternoon, we found ourselves
approaching a fleet of upwards of fifty sail, steering nearly
N. E. We run directly for their center; at 4 o'clock
found ourselves in their half-moon; concluding it impossible
that it could be any other than the English fleet, continued

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
our course for their center to avoid any apprehension
of a want of confidence in them. They soon dispatched
an 18-gun ship from their center, and two frigates,
one from their van and another from their rear, to beat
towards us&mdash;we being to windward. On approaching
the center ship under easy sail I fortunately bethought
myself that it would be but common prudence to steer so
far to windward of him as to be a grapeshot's distance
from him, to observe his force and maneuvering. When
we were abreast of him he fired a gun to leeward and
hoisted English colors. We immediately bore away and
meant to pass under his quarter, between him and the fleet
showing our American colors. This movement disconcerted
him, and it appeared to me he either conceived we
were either an American sloop of war, or an English one in
disguise, attempting to cut him off from the fleet; for while
we were in the act of wearing on his beam he hoisted French
colors and gave us a broadside. We immediately brought
our ship to the wind, and stood on about a mile&mdash;wore
towards the center of the fleet&mdash;hove about and crossed
him on the other tack, about half grapeshot distance, and
received his broadside; several shot fell on board of us
without much damage. All hands were active in clearing
ship for action, for our surprise had been complete.
In about ten minutes we began firing our stern chasers
and in a quarter of an hour gave him our broadside in
such style as evidently sickened him, for he immediately
luffed in the wind, gave us his broadside, went in stays

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
in great confusion, wore ship afterwards in a large circle,
and renewed the chase at a mile and a half distance&mdash;a
maneuver calculated to keep up appearances with the
fleet and escape our shot.
</p>
<p>"At midnight we had distanced them; the chasing rocket
signals being almost out of sight. We have been in constant
brushes ever since. The day after we left the fleet
we were chased till night by two frigates, whom we lost
sight of when it was dark. The next morning off Cape
St. Vincent, were chased by a French lateen-rigged vessel,
apparently 10 or 12 guns, one of them an 18-pounder.
We brought to for him, [but] his metal was too heavy for
ours, and his position to windward.... [As] it was not
in my power to cut him off we of course bore away and
saluted him with our long nines. He continued his chase
till dark, and when we were nearly by Cadiz, at sunset,
he made a signal to a consort whom we had just discovered
ahead. Having a strong breeze I was determined to pass
my stern over him if he did not make way for me. He
thought prudent to do so. At midnight we made the
lights in Cadiz city, but found no English fleet. After
lying to till daylight concluded that the French must have
gained the ascendancy in Cadiz and thought prudent to
proceed to this place, where we arrived at 12 o'clock,
popping at Frenchmen all the forenoon. At 10 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, off
Algesiras Point, were seriously attacked by a large lateener
who had on board more than 100 men. He came so near
our broadside as to allow our 6-pound grape to do execution

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
handsomely. We then bore away and gave him our
stern guns in a cool and deliberate manner, doing apparently
great execution. Our bars having cut his sails
considerably, he was thrown into confusion, struck both
his ensign and his pennant. I was then puzzled to know
what to do with so many men. Our ship was running
large, with all her steering sails out, so that we could not
immediately bring her to the wind; and we were immediately
off Algesiras Point, from which I had reason to
fear she might receive assistance, and my port, (Gibraltar)
in full view. These circumstances induced me to give
up the gratification of bringing him in. It was, however,
a satisfaction to flog the rascal in full view of the English
fleet who were to leeward. The risk of sending here is
great indeed for any ship short of our force in men and
guns&mdash;but particularly [when short of] heavy guns.
Two nines are better than six or eight sixes, and two long
twelves do better than twenty sixes.... I have now,
while writing to you, two of our countrymen in full view
who are prizes to these villains. Lord St. Vincent, in
a 50-gun ship, is in the act of retaking one of them. The
other goes into Algesiras without molestation."
</p>
<p>Spain took scores of American ships, and when the French
privateers carried an American ship into a Spanish port,
the Spanish officials invariably assisted in the robbery.
The other nations robbed in proportion to their power and
opportunity. The third volume of our <i>Foreign Relations</i>
contains a list of fifty-one American ships that were

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
carried into the ports of Denmark and Sweden. The
French aggressors were inspired primarily, as said, by
indignation; the English were acting in defence of their
maritime supremacy, as shall appear further on, but these
smaller powers of Europe were animated by no other
motive than that of the Algerine pirates.
</p>
<p>As to the total of the damages suffered from the French
republicans, it must be said that no complete calculation
was ever made. But documents written under oath show
that more than 600 ships were despoiled before the year
1800, and that losses amounting to more than $20,000,000
were sustained. These losses included ships and cargoes
only; incidental losses due to the conditions at sea could
not be measured.
</p>
<p>Though really a part of our naval history, perhaps it
may be worth adding that when, at last, our naval ships,
though few in numbers and small in size, were ordered to
sea to protect our trade, no more than three or four well-fought
actions were needed to bring the French Republic
spoliations to an end. It was, and, unhappily, it is yet,
in human nature to despise any appeal to altruistic notions
of right in an effort to secure justice, but all accord hearty
respect to him who is able and willing to fight for his rights.
We were amused by the antics of the Japanese as a nation
of artists; we took off our hats and stood erect with our
heels together in the presence of the heroes of the Battle
of the Yellow Sea.

<h2>CHAPTER VIII
<br />
<span class="s08">THE BRITISH AGGRESSIONS</span>
</h2>
<p><span class="b20">B</span>EFORE considering the aggressions of the British
government upon our shipping during the period
between the Revolution and the War of 1812, it
seems still more necessary than it was in the case of the
French to try to get the point of view of the aggressor.
The men who governed England were placed in power not
only to guard but to promote English interests against
those of all other nations. Patriotism and natural ambition
inspired them to do this as fully as possible. The
welfare of the nation being in their charge, it was their
duty to consider first of all entire safety from invasion,
as everybody believed then, and believes now, that safety
depended upon the supremacy of the nation upon the
high seas. To maintain that supremacy every Briton felt
obliged to make every needed sacrifice. Small wonder,
then, that in maintaining that supremacy the rulers of
England should have felt obliged to hamper all possible
rivals for that supremacy. The state of public mind at
the end of a century wherein England had been at war
four years for every three of peace demanded that the
British supremacy at sea be maintained at <i>any</i> cost; and

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the morality of the world has not even yet reached a condition
where an English patriot can feel sentiments differing
greatly from those of the end of the eighteenth century.
</p>
<p>At the beginning of the twentieth century, civilized
nations acknowledge certain rules of national conduct
called international law, but at the end of the eighteenth
nothing of the kind had any real weight in regulating
international affairs. Men quoted Vattel in their correspondence,
but the one recognized rule contained three
words only, "Might makes right." Practical, not altruistic,
considerations controlled all negotiations, <i>and
no nation had, or could expect to maintain, any "right"
which it was unwilling to support by force</i>. It was the
duty of neutral powers to build ships of the line, or meekly
suffer the consequences. The facts of history support no
statement more fully than this, that American shipping
suffered from spoliations, between 1783 and 1812, solely
because they begged, instead of fighting, for that freedom
of the sea which they claimed as a natural right.
</p>
<p>As an introduction to the story of the British aggressions,
here are a few extracts from letters written by one
Phineas Bond, a native-born American who served England
as consul at Philadelphia, beginning in 1787. The
letters were written either to the British Secretary of State
for Foreign Affairs, or to one of the under secretaries.
(See <i>An. Rep. Am. Hist. Asso.</i>, 1894.)
</p>
<p>On February 21, 1787, in referring to an act of Parliament
relating to the registry of English ships, Bond said

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
that "if properly pointed it must inevitably cramp the
remnant of commerce now enjoyed by this country." He
is confident that the "alarm and perplexity" which the
act occasioned in America, prove that it will be beneficial
to British shipping.
</p>
<p>On May 17 Bond said that the American ships from
China were bringing home more goods than the country
could use, and that the surplus was shipped to Europe,
where it would undersell the goods of the British East
India Company. By the use of bribes (he speaks plainly
of bribing officials), he obtained copies of the manifests of
all American ships from China, and forwarded them to
England. Then on July 2 he wrote:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"This country is so restricted by the regulations of
trade of other nations ... and so weak are the resources
of the merchants <i>here</i>, that if an early check or restraint can
be thrown in their way, either by thwarting their credit
or by withholding the articles suitable to their commerce,
they would never rally; and then, my Lord, they would
be confined to their coasting trade and to illicit communication
with the Spaniards: These come in a secret
manner into the ports of America and bring specie to a
large amount ... the amount of specie is enormous
... at least 500,000 dollars were brought into this port
last year." To take away this trade with the Spaniards
Bond advised the "establishing of a free port in the Bahamas
... from which the Spaniards could draw the
supplies they want."
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
In a letter dated September 29 Bond took a look ahead:
"The rumor of war has inspired the Americans with new
spirits: they anticipate the benefits of a free trade, and
already calculate upon the profits of being the carriers
to all the belligerent powers."
</p>
<p>In a letter dated November 20 Bond tells "of two persons,
natives of England who with great resolution and
no small personal risque purchased here and reshipped
to Liverpool three machines for spinning cotton and a
machine for carding cotton for spinning." The machines
had been brought from Liverpool "clandestinely ...
packed in queensware crates." They were bought by
the "natives of England" and reshipped to Liverpool in
order to hinder the establishment of a cotton-spinning
industry in the United States.
</p>
<p>Bond said he did not "apprehend" that any such factories
would be "speedily brought to a state of Rivalship
with those of Gt. Britain," but it was "fit to guard
against an evil which tho' at present in its infancy,"
might grow in time.
</p>
<p>In several letters Bond urged that restrictions be placed
upon passenger-carrying ships leaving England for the
United States, "Under color of a humane provision for the
comfort of" emigrants, in order to stop or at least "discourage"
all emigrants, and especially mechanics, likely
to be of value in developing the industries of the United
States.
</p>
<p>Of especial interest is the warning which Bond sent

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
when he learned that the British government considered
the propriety of admitting American vessels of limited size,
(seventy tons was offered later), into the trade of the
British West Indies. He said:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"Any indulgence of this sort would certainly divert the
trade out of its present channel&mdash;the people of New
England are an enterprising people, the number of their
ports and the locality of their situation favor the increase
of seamen. They navigate their vessels frugally and their
outfits are infinitely less expensive than the outfits of Brit.
vessels. When once admitted to trade with the W. India
Islands, ship building which has lain dormant, almost,
and which was formerly a source of great profit to this
country, would instantly be revived&mdash;<i>America would
soon monopolize</i> the advantages of carrying; limited as
to size the numbers of her vessels would be increased, and
by increasing the numbers would supply the means of
conveying all the produce of America which is consumed
in our islands, and that, too, at a much cheaper rate than
any other nation could afford. But the enterprising spirit
of the people of New England would, as soon as they
found the channels of profit open, be exerted to the raising
a maritime force which in case of future war might operate
very detrimentally to the interests of England."
</p>
<p>That Bond was encouraged in this kind of work appears
from the fact that he was promoted later. There was no
detail of American business too small to escape the careful
attention of the British government in its efforts to

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
throw what Bond called an "early check or restraint"
upon all American progress, and especially upon the
prosperity of American shipping.
</p>
<p>A comparison, briefly made, of the laws and regulations
of England and the United States follows:&mdash;
</p>
<p>The British prohibited American vessels from entering
the ports of their West India Islands, Canada, and other
American possessions, and their East India spice market.
We admitted British vessels into all our ports on payment
of a tonnage tax of fifty cents per ton (our ships paid six
cents per ton), and goods brought in British ships paid
a revenue duty of 10 per cent more than goods in ours.
</p>
<p>In the treaty made in 1794 the British offered to let our
vessels of no more than seventy tons enter their West
Indies on condition that we would admit British ships
of any size on payment of the same tax and duty as our
own.
</p>
<p>The British imposed double lighthouse taxes on American
vessels bound to any port in England except London.
We imposed no extra lighthouse dues.
</p>
<p>British merchants were prohibited from using American-built
vessels in a number of trades. We allowed our
merchants to use British-built vessels in any trade on payment
of the extra dues mentioned above.
</p>
<p>The British prohibited the importation of goods by
American vessels from every country except the United
States. We permitted the British vessels to bring us goods
from all countries.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
The British prohibited the importation of some of our
agricultural products during specified periods of time,
and of some at all times. We admitted the importation
of all British agricultural products at all times.
</p>
<p>An American citizen was not allowed to import some
goods into some ports of the British domain, even in British
ships. In other ports an extra tax was laid on the American.
We permitted the British citizen to import all goods
into all our ports, and we laid no extra tax upon him.
</p>
<p>The British prohibited the consumption of certain
American articles the importation of which they permitted.
We did not prohibit the consumption of any
British article.
</p>
<p>The British prohibited the importation of American
goods from all countries except the United States. We
permitted the importation of British goods from all
countries.
</p>
<p>Consul Bond, in a letter (April 19, 1789), to Lord
Carmarthen, berated Mr. Madison because "he by no
means adverts to that important consideration, that so
great indulgence has been granted by Gt. Britain to the
United States."
</p>
<p>Omitting for want of space any account of many previous
attacks upon American shipping, it may be said that
the first made in connection with the war upon the French
Republic was the order to British warships on June 8,
1793, to "detain all vessels laden wholly or in part with
corn, flour or meal" bound to any French port. It was

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
provided that each ship so captured should be restored,
but the cargo was to be confiscated for the account of
the British government, which was to pay for it the invoice
cost with 10 per cent added. This order was issued ostensibly
to starve the French republicans into submission to the
old monarchy, but it was well known that no such result
could follow because France had never depended upon
the United States for any part of its bread worth mention.
Thus, in 1792, when we exported 546,913 bushels of wheat
to Great Britain and her possessions, France took only
54 bushels. The order, therefore, had some other object
in view, and the brief story of the ship <i>Neptune</i>, Captain
Jeffries, is instructive at this point. When the <i>Neptune</i> was
captured under this order, she was restored as soon as convenient
to do so, and an order was issued for the payment
of the invoice price of her cargo with 10 per cent added.
The addition of 10 per cent for profit seemed at first glance
to be an effort to act with some degree of fairness, but as
a matter of fact the owners were deliberately robbed; the
market price of wheat in England, at that time, was very
much higher than the invoice price with 10 per cent
added, and Captain Jeffries pleaded for permission, not
to go on to the port for which he had been sailing (where
the price was still higher), but for permission to sell the
grain to merchants there in London, who were anxious
to give the market price; but the government insisted
on taking it at the mere advance of 10 per cent.
</p>
<p>We may suppose that Captain Jeffries's failure to be

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
satisfied with a profit of 10 per cent was considered a
plain illustration of American avarice.
</p>
<p>On November 6, 1793, British cruisers were ordered
to capture all neutral ships laden with the produce of the
French West Indies. American ships were carrying immense
quantities of those goods, and all the larger because
they were excluded from the British West Indies. To
make certain of a clean sweep of these American ships, the
order in council was kept secret for several weeks in order
to give the British cruisers time enough to get on the
ground and take everything unawares. (H. Adams, II, 322.)
</p>
<p>On January 8, 1794, this order was changed so as to
permit American ships to carry the French colonial produce
to American ports, but the direct trade to Europe was still
forbidden. In the meantime more than 200 American
vessels had been captured and confiscated under the
original order.
</p>
<p>While American ships were forbidden to carry French
colonial goods from the colonies direct to France, they were,
as said, yet allowed to carry the produce to the United
States and then reëxport it to Europe, provided it was
entered in the American port, landed, and all duties, etc.,
paid before the voyage was continued. In the case of
the <i>Polly</i>, decided April 29, 1800, Sir William Scott (Lord
Stowell), confirmed this right of American ships, and the
American minister "succeeded in obtaining from Pitt
an express acceptance of this rule." One may note that
this concession was obtained immediately after our warships

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
had been sent to protect our merchantmen from the
aggressions of the French; the guns of the <i>Constellation</i>
had been heard in London, so to speak.
</p>
<p>When, on April 29, 1803, England declared war upon
Napoleon, however, a new administration had been inaugurated
in the United States, and all Europe knew that
no use would be made of such American war-ships as remained
in commission. Accordingly, as a first measure
to hamper the American ships in their effort to become
carriers for the beleaguered French, two British frigates
were sent to Sandy Hook to detain and search all ships
for property belonging to the French. American waters
were occupied for the purpose of hampering American
trade. In the course of the blockade thus established, a
British gunner, just for a joke, fired a shot at a coaster,
aiming so as to frighten the crew. The man at the coaster's
helm was killed.
</p>
<p>This invasion of American waters was a fair notice of
the British determination to compel the United States to
abide by all English laws and orders in council made for
the protection of British shipping. By refusing to declare
war, the American administration justified the aggressors.
</p>
<p>Then the British government, still further to promote
British trade and shipping, adopted Phineas Bond's
advice, and established free ports in the West Indies, to
which small unarmed traders from the colonies of the
enemy were invited to come and buy British goods. These
free ports were supplied by British ships under convoy.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
In the meantime preparations were made to deprive
the Americans of the indirect trade from the French colonies
by way of the United States to Europe. On July 23, 1805,
Sir William Scott, reversing his decision in the case of
the <i>Polly</i>, decided that a ship called the <i>Essex</i> was a good
prize, although in a voyage from Bordeaux she had called
at Salem, discharged cargo, made repairs, and reloaded
before heading away for a West India port.
</p>
<p>The all-influential British navy had joined in with the
British ship-owner to demand that the American ships
should be excluded from all trade between the colonies of
the enemy and Europe. The ship-owners demanded it
because the American ship, in spite of the great expense of
the indirect voyage, was yet able to take the trade from the
British, even though they were supported by free ports and
other aids. The demand made by or for the British naval
officers was unique. When voiced by one James Stephens
(<i>War in Disguise; or the Frauds of the Neutral Flags</i>),
he pictured a British admiral grown old and full of honors
in the service, who, in spite of his honors, had been unable
"to wrest [from the enemy] the means of comfortably
sustaining those honors." As long as American ships
were allowed to engage in the indirect trade, the naval
officer would have to "look in vain for any subject of <i>safe</i>
and uncontested capture." If American ships were excluded,
they would still take chances, and they would then
be captured without danger and condemned without contest.
</p>
<p>Mere mention need be made of the British practice of

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
taking American sailors from American ships and compelling
them to serve in British war-ships. Many American
merchantmen were left short-handed upon the high
seas, and there is no doubt that some of them were, for
this reason, lost with all hands. The practice was maintained
as one method of depressing our navigation, but
the subject seems to belong to our naval histories.
</p>
<p>Brief space will serve for a consideration of the various
orders in council and paper blockades issued and laid in
1806 and 1807. In May, 1806, the British declared that
the European coast "from the river Elbe to the port of
Brest inclusive ... must be considered as blockaded."
No blockading fleet was maintained. In reply to this
Napoleon issued his Berlin decree declaring the British
islands "in a state of blockade," and that "all commerce
and correspondence with the British Islands is prohibited."
</p>
<p>The French navy was unable to go to sea; Napoleon
had only a few privateers with which to enforce his decree,
but the British used it as an excuse for the order in council
of January 7, 1807, by which no vessel was "permitted
to trade from one port to another both which ports shall"
be so far under the control of the enemy "<i>that British
vessels may not trade freely thereat</i>."
</p>
<p>"If we may not no one else shall." The chief influence
of this order upon American vessels was to interdict
their trade as coasters in Europe, and to prevent their
seeking a cargo in another port when they failed to find
one in the first port entered.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
The order in council of November 11, 1807, was issued
partly because, as it stated, that the one of January 7 had
failed to induce Napoleon to withdraw his Berlin decree,
and because no neutral power had declared war upon him
because of that failure. The chief reason for issuing it
however (and this was also plainly declared), was "for
<i>supporting that maritime power</i> which the exertions and
valor of his [the British king's] people have, under the
blessing of Providence enabled him to establish and maintain."
To this end all the ports from which "the British
flag is excluded" were declared in a state of blockade.
"Maritime power" meant "merchant marine."
</p>
<p>The principal ports of the world to which American
vessels had been accustomed to trade, having thus been
closed with a paper blockade, they were all reopened again
on condition that the trade to them be carried on by way
of England. On the 25th of the month it was further
provided that the ships thus trading by way of England
were to land their cargoes in the English port visited.
</p>
<p>This placed the ships of the United States in the condition
endured by American vessels in colonial days
when goods purchased in Europe had to be carried to
an English port and "laid on shore" before they were
taken to America. Some writers have supposed that this
was done as a step toward returning the United States
once more to the position of colonies. The fact is that
the rulers of England had found that they could not exclude
American ships altogether from the sea, and they had

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
determined, therefore, to make them serve British interests
as far as possible&mdash;first by carrying <i>British goods</i> to the
ports from which British ships were excluded, and second,
by making them pay a tribute by landing their cargoes in
English ports. Practically the United States was thus
made a vassal of England.
</p>
<p>In reply to this order Napoleon decreed that any ship
that should in any way submit to or take advantage of
it should be good prize.
</p>
<p>The dates of the several orders in council and decrees
are of some interest because these show that the British
began the series by the paper blockade from the Elbe to
Brest. But the chief interest is in the fact that the orders
were all issued for the benefit of British <i>trade</i>. The talk
found in various histories about "retaliation" and England's
"death struggle with tyranny" was all sham.
Said Spencer Percival, in a frank speech in Parliament,
(March 3, 1812):&mdash;
</p>
<p>"The object of the orders in council was not to destroy
the trade of the continent but to force the continent to
trade with us."
</p>
<p>"I am of the opinion," said Lord Hawkesbury, "that
<i>some decisive measure</i> in support of our own commerce
... is become indispensable, not merely as a measure
of commercial policy, <i>but in order to put the contest in
which we are engaged upon its true grounds</i>." (Quoted
by H. Adams, IV, 90.)
</p>
<p>But while England strove by every means to preserve

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
her trade and shipping at the expense of her American rival,
and Napoleon, with motives no higher than those of a
highwayman, confiscated American ships and cargoes to
the value of $10,000,000, the American merchant marine
prospered.
</p>
<p>On December 31, 1789, ships of an aggregate capacity
of 123,893 tons were registered under the American flag
for foreign trade. In 1792 the tonnage registered was
411,438. In 1793, the first year of extensive spoliations,
the tonnage was reduced to 367,734, but thereafter, in
spite of the fact that Americans were obliged to fight their
way through swarming enemies, our shipping grew until
in 1800 we made boast of the possession of 667,107
tons in the foreign trade. Further than that, British
shipping aggregating 115,000 tons entered and cleared
out of American ports in 1790, but in 1800, only
40,000 tons. From 1790 to 1792 the American tonnage
that entered and cleared averaged 54,000 tons a year;
in 1800 the tonnage that entered and cleared was
236,000.
</p>
<p>Even when the stupidity of the administration added
the embargo to all other ills afflicting our shipping, its
vigor was not destroyed. The registered tonnage fell
from 840,163 in 1807 to 765,252 in 1808 under the embargo,
but after the embargo was removed (March 1,
1809), the figures grew within the year to 906,855, and in
1810 we had 981,019 tons registered for foreign trade.
Moreover, 127,000 tons of new ships were built during that

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
year, and in that year, too, our ships carried 91.5 per cent
of all American imports and exports.
</p>
<p>The reasons for this prosperity are readily found.
American enterprise was, in those days, irrepressible.
When Salem merchants heard that dried sea slugs (<i>bêche
de mer</i>) were highly prized as food in China, and that
the waters of the Fiji Islands swarmed with the worms,
they despatched the bark <i>Active</i> (July 26, 1811), under
Captain William P. Richardson, to collect and dry enough
of the slugs to freight the ship for the Canton market. A
more remarkable illustration of the enterprise of the day
is found, perhaps, in the fact that when a colony of New
Englanders settled at Marietta, Ohio (Captain Abraham
Whipple was of the number), they began to build ships
there for the deep-water trade. The brig <i>St. Clair</i>, of 110
tons, was launched in 1800. In 1801 a ship of 230 tons
and a brig of 126 were built. Three ships of 300 or more
tons were completed in 1806 besides a number of smaller
ones. A similar record was made the next year. The
largest ship built there was the <i>Francis</i>, of 350 tons, built
by Whitney for B. J. Gilman. She was of the largest
size of her day. In all, seven ships, eleven brigs, six
schooners, and two gunboats (for the navy), were built at
Marietta before the War of 1812. Imagine a full-rigged
ship, with all sails set, plunging down over the Falls of
the Ohio!
</p>
<p>To enterprise was added unequalled opportunity. The
wars of Europe drove the ships of European nations

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
from the sea, save only as voyages were made under
convoy. The Americans took the risks because the
pay was adequate. Captain George Coggeshall, in
<i>American Privateers</i> (p. 200), says he received $45 per
ton freight from Bordeaux to Boston. In the voyage
of Captain Elias Hasket Derby, described in the last
chapter, his cargo carried to Gibraltar cost him $43,275.
The net profit made upon it was more than
$100,000.
</p>
<p>How the perils of trade affected the quality of American
ships, especially their speed, must have mention. Hundreds
of our vessels were captured by the enemy, but many
more were chased in vain. It was at this time that the
Baltimore clippers gained world-wide fame. The narrow
and shoal waters of the Chesapeake had compelled Baltimore
designers to make shallow models that could beat
to windward swiftly in all winds. The peculiarity of
these vessels was the great breadth of beam and a consequent
ability to carry large areas of sail. No models
equalled those of Baltimore, and when speed was the price
of safety at sea, the Baltimore model was copied everywhere
in America.

<p class="caption"><a id="Ill7"></a><span class="smcap">A Virginia Pilot-boat, with a Distant View of Cape Henry, at the Entrance of the Chesapeake</span>
</p>
</div>
<p>When our tonnage in the foreign trade almost reached
the million mark in 1810, the most efficient ships in the
world were those under the American flag. And the
character of our merchant seamen is shown by the fact
that when the British confiscated one of our ships, they
were obliged to cut down her spars before they could

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
handle her. And yet some of our nautical writers would
have us believe that American ships increased in number
in those days because, they say, a discriminating duty
laid on imports brought to the country in foreign
ships afforded "protection" to ships under the American
flag!

<h2>CHAPTER IX
<br />
<span class="s08">THE BEGINNINGS OF STEAM NAVIGATION</span>
</h2>
<p><span class="b20">I</span>T will help us to appreciate the work of the men
who first experimented with steam-driven ships if we
recall the fact that James Watt, working at Soho,
near Birmingham, England, invented the engine which
used steam on both sides of the piston in 1782, and that
it was for many years after that date an enormously heavy
and cumbersome machine. From this fact we see the
state of the mechanic arts in England at the end of the
eighteenth century, when practical experiments in steam
navigation were first begun. That the state of those arts
was still lower in the United States would be naturally
inferred from the story of Bond's efforts to restrain progress
by reëxporting the machinery that had been imported at
Philadelphia. As a matter of fact, when one American
inventor began to make experiments in steam navigation,
he was obliged first of all to train men in the work of
building engines; he was unable to find, anywhere in the
country, men with the necessary skill.
</p>
<p>One of the most curious of the early experiments was
that made by James Rumsey, who was a bath tender at

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
a pleasure resort in Virginia. He first planned to mount
an old-style, single-acting engine in a boat, connect it
with a pump, draw in water through a pipe at the bow,
and then force it out astern. When this plan was explained
to Washington, he wrote a testimonial, saying, "the discovery
is of great importance." A boat built on this plan
was eventually driven at a speed of four miles an hour.
Rumsey also experimented with a screw propeller, but
he was poor, and could not carry the experiment to a
conclusion. Finally he went to England to get capital
(a fact to be remembered), and there he died before he
could accomplish anything of real moment.
</p>
<p>Another interesting experimenter was John Fitch, of
Pennsylvania, a man who was handy in the use of tools,
and who was also a surveyor and map-maker. On
December 2, 1785, he presented to the American Philosophical
Society of Philadelphia a model, with drawings,
of a steamboat. The New Jersey legislature then
gave him the exclusive right to navigate the waters of the
State with steamboats, and a company was organized to
develop the invention. The first engine built had a 3-inch
cylinder. It was mounted in a skiff and was connected
at one time with a screw propeller, at another with an
endless chain dragging alongside, and with a "screw and
paddles," but neither device would drive the boat at a
practical speed. Then Fitch conceived the idea of driving
with paddles somewhat after the fashion of canoe
men. This plan worked so well that a boat forty feet long

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
was built and furnished with an engine having a 12-inch
cylinder. In spite of the fact that the cylinder of this
engine had wooden ends that leaked, and a piston that
did not fit the bore, the boat was driven at a speed of four
knots an hour.
</p>
<p>In 1788 Fitch built a boat sixty feet long with a larger
engine, and in October she carried thirty passengers to
Burlington, New Jersey, a distance of twenty miles, in
three hours and ten minutes. The speed of this boat being
unsatisfactory, still another was built, and in May, 1790,
she covered a measured mile in seven and a half minutes,
or at the rate of eight miles an hour. She was then put
on the river as a packet plying between Philadelphia and
Trenton, and made more than thirty trips of which records
remain. She was operated by paddles at the stern.
</p>
<p>Though Fitch's plan was not the best conceivable, it
is now admitted that his boat was a mechanical success.
He built a workable boat, but, unhappily, he was far ahead
of his day in his hopes and work. The people were not
yet ready for steam navigation, and the company failed
to pay dividends. Meantime another boat that he had
built to run on the Mississippi was wrecked, and that loss
ended the enterprise. Fitch finally went to the banks of
the Ohio, where he continued his efforts without success.
</p>
<p>"The day will come," he wrote, "when some more
powerful man will get fame and fortune from <i>my</i> invention,
but nobody will believe that poor John Fitch can do anything
worthy of attention." Then he killed himself.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
In 1786, Oliver Evans, a Philadelphia millwright, asked
the legislature of the State to give him the exclusive right
to build steam gristmills and road-wagons,&mdash;automobiles,
in other words,&mdash;but his plans were not treated seriously.
In 1801, however, he built a steam plaster mill, and in
1804 he demonstrated, in a way that yet astonishes the
reader, the entire feasibility of steam navigation.
</p>
<p>Having obtained a contract for dredging some of the
slips along the Philadelphia water front, he built a scow,
30 ✕ 12 feet large, to carry the dredge. The scow was
put together at his shop, which was located a mile from
the Schuylkill. When done, he mounted a steam engine,
(5 ✕ 19 inches large), on its deck, placed temporary wooden
axles with temporary wooden wheels underneath, connected
the axles and engine shaft, and then steamed away
to the river. There he removed the wheels and put a paddle
wheel at the stern for use afloat. Then he launched
his scow, steamed down the Schuylkill and up to the
slips he was to dredge. The engine was thereafter used
in the work of dredging. Although that was in 1804, the
people were not yet ready for steam navigation. The only
practical result of the work of Evans was the adoption of
the high-pressure engine, so called. His engine had no
condenser. It exhausted its steam into the open air, and
this style of engine was found to be best adapted for use
on the steamboats of the Western rivers, later on.
</p>
<p>In the meantime Robert Fulton, who was to succeed, had
been at work. Fulton was a Pennsylvania artist who had

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
shown so much talent that he went to England to study
under Benjamin West. In the meantime, however, he had
been greatly interested in mechanics, and had dreamed
of steamboats. In London his thoughts turned more and
more to mechanics, and in 1793 he abandoned art to take
up his life-work.
</p>
<p>In the popular view the most interesting chapter in Fulton's
life is that relating the story of the first voyage of his
first steamship; but for the encouragement of struggling
inventors the most important facts in his life are those
showing how he went about his task. For Fulton made
a thorough study of his subject; while experimenting for
himself he took care to learn as much as possible about
what others had already done in the same line. In modern
days, when every important invention is known to be a
development from crude ideas and appliances into a perfect
design, it seems not a little curious to read that in
Fulton's time his method of work&mdash;his determination
to learn his subject thoroughly before building&mdash;was
considered not quite creditable. Invention, it was thought,
consisted in working out an inspiration in the dark!
</p>
<p>Fulton's first effort to build a steamship was made in
1794, when he went to Paris and tried to induce the
National Convention to take up the invention, and thus
"deliver France and the whole world from British oppression."
Of course the chaotic conditions in Paris prevented
the realization of his hopes.
</p>
<p>Returning to England, Fulton published a pamphlet

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
on steam navigation (1796), but failed to interest the
people. Then he became interested in marine torpedoes
and submarine navigation. With these ideas he went
again to Paris (1802), where he made experiments in
working a boat under water, but failed to convince Napoleon,
who was then the despotic ruler of France. While
thus engaged, however, he met Robert R. Livingston, the
American minister to France. In connection with John
Stevens and Nicholas J. Roosevelt, of New Jersey, Livingston
had already made experiments looking toward steam
navigation on the Hudson, and in aid of his enterprise
had secured from the legislature of New York the exclusive
privilege of navigating New York waters with
steamboats. This privilege had expired by limitation,
and the experiments had come to an end, so far as he was
concerned, but on meeting the enthusiastic Fulton he at
once became interested again, and furnished money for
further experiments. Thereupon Fulton built a steamboat
that, when launched upon the Seine, in 1803, instantly
broke in two and sank. The frames were not
strong enough. Fishing up the engine, Fulton built a
stronger hull, and this time the engine worked, though the
speed was so slow that only Fulton and Livingston believed
the experiment to be a success.
</p>
<p>With the optimism that breeds success, Fulton, backed
by Livingston, now made drawings of an engine to be used
in a boat which he purposed building upon the Hudson,
and these plans he carried to England, where he ordered

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
his engine of Watt, who was building the most efficient
engines in use.
</p>
<p>In the meantime, William Symington, a Scotch engine
builder, had been experimenting with steamboats. In
1789 he had installed an engine upon a double-hulled yacht,
with which one Patrick Millar navigated Lake Dalwinston,
in Scotland. Although Millar spent $150,000 in
experiments with steam, nothing came of them. In 1801
Symington induced Lord Dundas, president of the Forth
&amp; Clyde Canal Company, to build a steam-tug for towing
barges.
</p>
<p>This tug, named the <i>Charlotte Dundas</i>, had an engine
with a 22-inch cylinder (stroke four feet), and the piston
was connected directly with the shaft of a stern paddle-wheel
by means of a piston rod and a connecting rod&mdash;a
plan of such simplicity that it came into universal use
later on. The rudder of the boat was handled by means
of a wheel placed near the bow, and this plan, too, received
universal approval. In March, 1802, this tug towed two
70-ton barges nineteen miles and a half, against a strong
wind, in six hours. As a demonstration of the feasibility
of steam navigation on smooth water, that passage should
have been entirely convincing, but the fear that the wash
from the wheel, or wheels (for Symington thought to try
side-wheels), would injure the banks of the canal, prevented
the adoption of the tug.
</p>
<p>Fulton had learned about the experiments with this tug,
and while in England contracting for the engine mentioned,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
he went to Scotland and visited Symington, who fired up
the boat and showed Fulton how it worked.
</p>
<p>In December, 1806, Fulton came to New York, where
he contracted with Charles Brown, who had a shipyard
on East River, between Stanton and Third streets, for
the hull of a new boat. The model of this hull is memorable.
In planning ships in those days it was customary
to make them approximately three and a half times as long
as they were broad, and at least half as deep as they
were broad. But Fulton's plans called for a keelless
hull 140 feet long over all, by 13 feet wide, and only 7 feet
deep. One feels a certain sympathy, even now, for the
sailors of that day who, on learning the facts about this
ship, named it <i>Fulton's Folly</i>.
</p>
<p>The boiler for supplying the engine with steam was 20
feet long, 8 wide, and 7 feet deep. It was set in masonry.
The fuel used was dry pine. The engine had a cylinder
24 inches in diameter with a 4-foot stroke. It was not
a typical Watt engine, however, for Watt's piston rods
were kept in line by a combination of levers and rods known
as a "parallel motion," while Fulton had called for a cross-head
on the end of the piston rod, and the cross-head worked
in guides in an A-frame. From each end of the cross-head
hung a connecting rod. These connecting rods
were joined to a "bell-crank," which was not unlike a
"walking beam" in the modern river-boat, but it was
located down in the hull. Connecting rods led from the
bell-crank to cog-wheels on the inner ends of the two main

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
shafts. The cog-wheels served as cranks which turned
with the vibrations of the bell-crank. The paddle-wheels
were on the outboard ends of the main shafts, of course.
Then cog-wheels on the inner ends of these shafts geared
into pinions on a smaller shaft which carried two fly-wheels,
placed outside the hull, which were provided to carry
the engine over the "dead centre" at each end of the
stroke. The paddle-wheels were 14 feet in diameter.
The main shafts were each of cast iron, and 4½ inches
in diameter. The A-frame and guides, the cross-head,
the bell-crank and connecting rods to the cross-head, and
crank cog-wheels, the crank-wheels, paddle-wheels, and
shafts, and the fly-wheels and their driving gear were all
of Fulton's design.
</p>
<p>According to Fulton's diary, he paid Watt £548 for the
engine. The boiler, built by Cave &amp; Son, of London,
cost "at 2<i>s</i> 2<i>d</i> the pound, £476 11<i>s</i> 2<i>d</i>." This was the first
engine of the kind that Watt was allowed to build for
export, and Fulton writes on March 22, 1805:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"Fee at the treasury on receiving permission to ship the
engine to America, £2 14<i>s</i> 6<i>d</i>."
</p>
<p>Fulton had no little trouble in raising the money for
his boat. Livingston contributed the larger share, while
Joel Barlow and David Dunham gave the next larger
shares. The remainder of the sum was collected among
personal friends by personal solicitation, and that was
work that tried the soul of the man. The fact that the
engine lay on the pier where it was landed for a period of

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
six months because Fulton could not raise the money to
pay the freight is significant.

</p>
</div>
<p>The new ship was named <i>Clermont</i>, the name of Livingston's
home on the Hudson. At noon on Monday, August
17, 1807, she was lying near the old State prison which
stood on land now bounded by Washington, West Tenth,
West and Charles streets, and thousands of people gathered
to gaze at the remarkable vessel because it had been announced
that she was to make a trial trip some time during
the day. They observed that Brown, the builder, was
working at some sails stretched to a mast standing at each
end of the hull, although the sails were not set. A man
named Maxwell (he had been brought from the shop
of the London makers) was tinkering around the boiler&mdash;stopping
leaks with melted lead, very likely, as he did,
at any rate, later. Another man, Van Lea, was adjusting
what is called a harpoon gun in the records. Harpoon
guns, as the American whalers know them, were not yet
invented, but swivels had previously been used for throwing
harpoons, and this was, perhaps, such a gun. What
it was to be used for is not recorded. The spectators were
naturally cynical, and the humorists of the class that in
modern days write the jokes for newspapers, shouted to
Fulton: "God help you, Bobby!" "Bring us back a
chip of the north pole!" "A fool and his money are soon
parted!" The small boys whistled, and also yowled like
cats. Fulton's correspondence shows that his sensitive
soul was cut to the quick.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
At 1 o'clock, as the start was described by the <i>Evening
Post</i>, everything seemed ready, and Fulton told Captain
Moses Rogers<a id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor"><sup>[6]</sup></a> to cast off the lines. The order was given
to the engineer, Stevens Rogers, a relative of the captain,
to start the machinery. A long blast was blown on a big
tin horn as a warning to near-by boats, and then there
was a "strange creaking, whirring, churning sound, a hiss
of the escaping steam; the awkward-looking wheels,
towering full seven feet above the deck on either side,
began to turn, and we were really started on the first
steamboat voyage on the Hudson." The next moment,
however, the spectators saw the machine come to a sudden
stop, and, supposing it had failed, they gave a derisive
shout. The captain of a passing river-sailing packet
sheered his boat close in to the pier line, and "made a
sarcastic offer" to "throw us a line and tow us to Albany."
</p>
<p>Perhaps the jeering at this time did not hurt Fulton so
much as that previously mentioned, for he had ordered
the engine stopped in order to readjust the boards or floats
on the paddle-wheels. He had noted that they dipped
too far into the water. An hour or more passed while
the crew did this work. When it was done and the throttle
was again opened, there was less strain on the machinery,
and the <i>Clermont</i> moved smoothly away from the landing.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
"The jeers of the ignorant, who had neither sense nor
feeling enough to suppress their contemptuous ridicule
and rude jokes, were silenced for a moment by a vulgar
astonishment which deprived them of the power of utterance
till the triumph of genius extorted from the incredulous
multitude which crowded the shores shouts and
acclamations of congratulation and applause." (Colden's
<i>Life of Robert Fulton</i>.)
</p>
<p>Heading across to the west side of the river to escape
the main current of the tide, the <i>Clermont</i> passed the sloop
whose captain had jeered her (the passengers on the
<i>Clermont</i> yelled ecstatically at him when they saw his look
of wonder), and then steamed along under the shadows
of the Palisades. Night came on as she entered the
Tappan Zee, and because it was a dark night the crews
of a number of river-sloops saw a vision that they remembered
vividly the remainder of their lives. For while
they gazed down the river, knowing nothing of an experiment
in steam navigation, they saw far away through
the darkness the flame and sparks that poured from the
smokestack of the <i>Clermont</i>&mdash;a cloud of fire moving
along between heaven and earth like that which had
guided the Children of Israel in the desert. Then, as
it drew near, a hoarse growling was heard and a frightful
form was seen coming up the river directly against
the tide. In abject terror many crews jumped into small
boats and fled ashore. Others sought shelter in the holds
of their boats and drew the hatches tight, while others

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
still fell upon their knees "and besought Providence to
protect them from the horrible monster."
</p>
<p>In the meantime the guests on the <i>Clermont</i> (she carried
invited guests only on this trip), finding the river air somewhat
chilly, gathered in the cabin, where, by the flickering
light of a "candle in its high protecting glass," they discussed
"the popular Salmagundi papers," speculated
"on Mr. Irving's forthcoming Knickerbocker's <i>History
of New York</i>," and finally "began to ply Mr. Fulton with
questions about the steamboat and what had led up to it."
They also sang "Ye Banks and Braes o' Bonny Doon,"
a favorite song with Fulton.
</p>
<p>Twice on the way up the river the <i>Clermont</i> stopped for
fuel, one of the deck hands awakening the echoes with the
big tin horn on each occasion to let the wood-yard men know
that she was about to land. Then, just twenty-four hours
after leaving New York, she cast anchor before the home
of Livingston. The distance she had covered was 110
miles. She remained here until the next day, and it is
noted in the histories that during the evening Livingston
and a party of friends boarded the <i>Clermont</i>, where,
in a congratulatory speech, he announced the engagement
of his niece, Miss Harriet Livingston, to Robert
Fulton.
</p>
<p>Leaving the next morning at 9 o'clock, the <i>Clermont</i>
reached Albany at five in the afternoon. In her run to
that city the <i>Clermont</i> had averaged just under five miles
an hour, regardless of wind and tide.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
While neither freight nor paying passengers had been
carried on the trip up, the boat was now advertised as a
packet. Thereupon a number of men came on board for
a passage to New York, and when one of these tendered
the money for the trip, tears came into Fulton's eyes. For
more than twenty years he had hoped against hope, and
now he saw the fruition of his work.
</p>
<p>"Although the prospect of personal emolument has been
some inducement to me," he wrote to an intimate friend,
"yet I feel infinitely more pleasure in reflecting on the immense
advantages my country will derive from the invention."
</p>
<p>On her return to New York the <i>Clermont</i> began her
career as an Albany packet, with regular dates for leaving
each end of the route. She was advertised in the <i>Evening
Post</i>, of New York, on September 2, 1807, as follows:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"The North River steamboat will leave Paulus Hook
Ferry on Friday the fourth of September, at six in the
morning, and arrive at Albany on Saturday at six in the
afternoon.
</p>
<p>"Provisions, good berths, and accommodations are provided.
</p>
<p>"The charge to each passenger is as follows:&mdash;

</p>
<p>"The steamboat will leave Albany on Monday the

</p>
<p>Meals were served without extra charge, and baggage
weighing sixty pounds was carried free with each adult
passenger. The freight rate to Albany was three cents
a pound. The <i>Clermont</i> left New York on her first trip
as packet at 6 o'clock in the morning on September 4, 1807,
carrying twelve through and three way passengers. It
was noted in the papers of the period that people were
very much incensed because the steamer left her pier
promptly at the hour advertised. They had been accustomed
to having the river-sloops wait for them.
</p>
<p>Morrison points out, in his <i>American Steam Navigation</i>,
that no single detail of the <i>Clermont</i> was invented by
Fulton. As the <i>North American Review</i> of July, 1838,
says, the "great and surpassing merit of Fulton consisted
not so much in absolute originality as in the skill
with which he availed himself of all the theoretic knowledge
of the day, and applied it to practical purposes."
His choice of location for the inauguration of steam navigation
is to be noted, for New York and the Hudson
afforded an amount of traffic perhaps more valuable than
could have been found elsewhere for such a vessel. Moreover,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
he was fortunate in making the trial at a time when
the public were sufficiently enlightened to appreciate the
value of steam.
</p>
<p>The number of passengers and the amount of freight
carried by the <i>Clermont</i> in the fall of 1807 led Fulton to
rebuild her during the winter, in order to give her greater
capacity. Having a monopoly of the waters by act of the
legislature (the monopoly was contrary to the Constitution
of the United States, but the courts did not decide
the matter until 1824), Fulton had no trouble in raising
capital, and with the growth of traffic a new steamer, the
<i>Car of Neptune</i>, was placed on the river in 1808. The
<i>Paragon</i> was built in 1811, and in 1812 the <i>Fire Fly</i> was
built for way traffic. On the whole, however, the evolution
of steam navigation on the Hudson was slow, at least
so far as improvement in the vessels employed was concerned,
until the monopoly was broken. For Fulton died
in 1815, and his associates were not progressive. In 1825 an
opposition line put on two steamers that were much superior
to those of the old line, and in 1827 they added a third.
In this year Robert L. Stevens, a son of John Stevens, put
a third line of steamers on the river, and in 1828 some Albany
capitalists sought a share of the traffic with a steamer called
the <i>De Witt Clinton</i> that made a record of more than
fourteen miles an hour between Albany and New York.
</p>
<p>In 1832 the companies on the river consolidated, and
used the superfluous boats in a night line that was successful
from the first.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Two notable improvements were made in the engines in
the meantime. Robert L. Stevens designed a light wrought-iron
"walking beam" to replace the heavy cast-iron beam
that was previously used. Then in 1824 James P. Allaire,
who had made a reputation as an engine builder, brought
out a "compound" engine. A compound engine has two
or more cylinders of different diameters coupled to the one
shaft. In the Watt engines the steam was conducted from
the boiler to one end of the cylinder and allowed to flow
in until the piston was driven almost to the opposite end.
Then it was shut off and the way to the condenser was
opened. Later it was found that if the flow of steam was
cut off at half the length of stroke and the steam already in
the cylinder was allowed to work by expansion, the total
power of the engine was reduced only a little, while the saving
of coal was very great. While thinking of this fact, it
occurred to Allaire that the principle involved might be
used to better advantage if the steam was taken at full
pressure into a small cylinder and exhausted thence into a
second and larger one to work by its expansive power.
The <i>Henry Eckford</i>, the <i>Sun</i>, and a number of others were
supplied with engines on this principle. The <i>Eckford</i>
had a small cylinder 12 inches in diameter and a large one
of 24. Both had the same stroke, of course. But, curiously
enough, it was not until about 1870 that compound
engines became the fashion.
</p>
<p>The racing era, as one may call it, began on the Hudson
about 1835, the year that Daniel Drew became interested

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
in the Hudson River steamers. Racing had been done
before the consolidation of 1832, but it was mild in comparison
with that under Drew's initiation. An unreasoning
mania for speed took possession of the public as well as of
the owners of steamers. Though no practical end was to
be served by the saving of an hour in the time required in
the trip from New York to Albany, every sacrifice was made
and every risk was taken to secure it. Instead of going to
a pier or dock to land way-passengers at the towns along
the river, the unfortunates were dumped into a small skiff
that was towed at the end of a long rope. Then, as the
steamer ran in close, but not too close, to the landing, the
man in charge of the skiff, using a steering oar, sheered it
within a few feet of the landing, and the passengers were
told to jump. And jump they did. Of course a few fell
into the water at every trip; perhaps some were drowned
thereby. But the steamer's reputation for making quick
passages was maintained, and for a long time the public
protested in vain. When legislation was invoked (1842)
the act was opposed as an unwarranted attempt to interfere
with private business which could much better regulate
itself!
</p>
<p>It is an interesting fact that while the racing on the Mississippi
resulted in the explosion of many boilers and the
consequent loss of hundreds of lives, no such disasters occurred
on the Hudson. The Hudson immunity was due
to a difference in machinery. On the Mississippi "high-pressure"
engines were used&mdash;there was no condenser,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
and the steam, which was sometimes carried at a pressure
of 150 pounds to the square inch, was exhausted, after use,
into the open air. When the safety-valve on such a
boiler was tied down and the fire was urged until an explosion
followed, the whole boat was ripped to pieces. On
the Hudson condensers were used because the water was
deeper and the extra weight was not of quite so much
importance. Moreover, fuel was more expensive, and the
low-pressure engine was more economical. Hudson River
boats often reached the end of the run with boiler-plates
bulging and ruined, but the heartrending disasters of the
Mississippi were unknown in the East.
</p>
<p>From the Hudson the use of steam spread first to the
Delaware. John Stevens, who had been associated with
Livingston and Roosevelt at the end of the eighteenth century,
continued his experiments after Livingston went to
France as American minister. He could not find any
mechanics fit to help him carry out his ideas, but he built a
machine shop and trained young men for the work. In
1804 he made a number of trips on the Hudson with a 25-foot
boat that was propelled by screws. He also invented
the tubular boiler "which at least has been the means of
working wonders, for in a boiler six feet long, four feet
wide and two feet deep he exposed four hundred feet of
surface, in the most advantageous manner, to the action of
fire." (Macfarlane, <i>History of Propellers</i>.)
</p>
<p>In 1807, while Fulton was bringing out the <i>Clermont</i>,
Stevens had a smaller, but none the less practical, boat,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
almost ready. He missed the honor of leading by no more
than two weeks. Being unable to use her on the Hudson,
Stevens, in June, 1808, sent her to the Delaware, under the
command of Captain Moses Rogers, who had commanded
the <i>Clermont</i> on her first voyages, and his son, Robert L.,
served as engineer. Thus this vessel&mdash;she was named
the <i>Phœnix</i>&mdash;was the first steamer that ever went to
sea. On the Delaware the <i>Phœnix</i> proved a commercial
success.
</p>
<p>The next step in the expansion of steam navigation was
taken when Nicholas J. Roosevelt built the steamer <i>New
Orleans</i> at Pittsburg (1811), and demonstrated to the incredulous
frontiersmen of the region&mdash;especially to the
"half horse, half alligator" keel boatmen&mdash;that a steam-driven
boat could overcome the current of the swiftest part
of the Mississippi.
</p>
<p>In 1813 Fulton and his associates reached out for alongshore
trade by building the <i>Fulton</i> for use between New
York and New Haven, but because of the activity of the
British war-ships on the blockade, she did not make her
first trip until March 21, 1815, when she carried thirty
passengers to New Haven in eleven hours.
</p>
<p>The <i>Massachusetts</i> was the first steamer in use at Boston.
She began plying to Salem in 1817. In the same year the
<i>Fire Fly</i> was sent from New York to Rhode Island, where
she was used between Providence and Newport. Rounding
Point Judith in this vessel was considered a feat
showing extraordinary courage, and this, too, among sailors

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
who thought nothing of a voyage around the world in a
ship less than a hundred feet long.
</p>
<p>In 1818 the <i>Walk-in-the-water</i> was built at Black Rock,
(now a part of Buffalo), on the Niagara River, for use on
the Great Lakes. When ready for her trial trip, she was
unable to stem the river current until eight yoke of oxen
were brought to her assistance, but once on the lake she did
well. She made her first trip to Detroit, starting on
August 20, 1818, and covered the distance in about forty
hours, using a cord of wood an hour.
</p>
<p>By the annual report of the Commissioner of Navigation
it appears that four steamboats, aggregation 457 tons, were
built in the United States in 1812, the first year for which
there is a record. In 1813 seven of an aggregate tonnage
of 1430 were built, and in 1819 the number was twenty-eight,
with a tonnage of 7291. More than a hundred had
been built in all. This expansion was almost but not
quite all made upon inland or sheltered waters. Fulton
had looked toward the high seas. He had built a steamship,
which he named the <i>Emperor Alexander</i>, to sell to the
Russian government, but the War of 1812 prevented his
trying to navigate her across the ocean, and she was eventually
worn out at home. During the war he built the huge
war steamer <i>Demologos</i>, a vessel fit to go along the coast,
and crude as she was, she would have changed the manner
of war at sea had she been set afloat a year sooner.
</p>
<p>The year 1819 is especially memorable because a transatlantic
steam passage was then made. It appears that

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
Captain Moses Rogers was the originator of the venture.
In 1818 Francis Fickett built a common sailing ship at
New York that was 100 feet long by 28 broad and 14 deep.
Rogers had had the honor of first navigating the sea with
a steamer, and he had been selected in 1816, because of his
reputation for courage and skill, to take the steamer <i>New
Jersey</i> from New York to the Chesapeake, a voyage thought
to be full of danger for such a vessel. He was now inspired
with the ambition to be the first to drive a steamship
across the Atlantic, and after a look at the ship that
Fickett was building, he persuaded Scarborough &amp; Isaacs,
ship merchants of Savannah, to buy and fit her with a steam
engine for use between Savannah and Liverpool.
</p>
<p>The engine for this ship was built by Stephen Vail, of
Speedwell, New Jersey, and the boiler by David Dod, of
Elizabethtown, New Jersey. It is worth while to interrupt
the narrative to consider these two facts. At the
beginning of the century mechanics had been so scarce
in the nation that Stevens had to train men for his
work. But in 1819 mechanics and shops fitted for engine
building were found not only in the larger cities but in
some of the smaller towns close to navigable waters.
That these shops had been brought into existence through
the mechanical progress&mdash;perhaps it may be called the
mechanical awakening&mdash;that was due to the success of
steam navigation is beyond question. Many machine
shops had been built, and were profitably employed. They
not only built engines, but other tools for many kinds

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
of work. The day when a British consul like Bond could
hamper the progress of American manufactures by reëxporting
tools made in England was passing.
</p>
<p>The paddle-wheels fitted to the new ship for use on the
Atlantic were made of iron. They had eight radial arms,
each so arranged (according to Preble) that they could be
folded up like a fan and laid inboard when the ship was
under sail; for her sailing rig was retained.
</p>
<p>Leaving New York on March 28, 1819, under Captain
Rogers, this ship (she was named <i>Savannah</i>) ran to her
home port in eight days and fifteen hours, during which
she used steam for forty-one and a half hours. On May 24
she sailed for Liverpool, and made the passage in twenty-seven
days, during which she used steam for eighty hours.
While off the coast of Ireland the crew of a revenue cutter
that saw her supposed she was on fire, and made haste to
go to her assistance. In a trip from Liverpool to St. Petersburg,
Russia, occupying, with stops at ports on the way,
thirty-three days, she was under steam ten days. She
finally arrived back at Savannah on November 30, and then
went to New York, where her machinery was removed and
sold.
</p>
<p>The Savannah was what would now be called an auxiliary
steamer; steam was used when the wind did not serve.
She failed to inaugurate steam traffic across the Atlantic
chiefly because of the space occupied by fuel&mdash;wood.
</p>
<p>Although Captain R. B. Forbes, one of the ablest seamen
the nation ever produced, built an auxiliary steamer (the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
<i>Massachusetts</i>) in 1845, that made profitable voyages,
and there were features of the system that make it seem
very attractive for certain trades, few vessels of the class
have ever been used.
</p>
<p>The year 1819 is also memorable because of an effort to
establish a line of steamers running from New York to
New Orleans, with stops at Charleston, South Carolina,
and Havana, Cuba, on the way. The line was maintained
for five years, and then withdrawn because it could not be
made to pay.
</p>
<p>In 1819, too, a ship was put on the route between Mobile
and New Orleans, but this was also a failure.
</p>
<p>In 1822 the steamer <i>New York</i> began to ply between
New York and Norfolk, but she was unable to compete
with the sailing packets. The steamer <i>Patent</i>, that began
making regular voyages between Boston and Maine ports
in 1823, also failed to pay dividends.
</p>
<p>Not to add details of this kind, it may be said that while
fortunes were made in steamboats plying on inland waters
of the United States, almost every venture made with
American steamers upon the ocean during the thirty years
following the <i>Clermont's</i> first trip on the Hudson proved unprofitable.
In connection with this dismal record the story
of the steamer <i>Home</i>, built for the trade between New York
and Charleston, South Carolina, is instructive. Keeping
in mind the fact that this steamer was designed to round
Cape Hatteras, where the worst storms on the coast were
known to rage, consider these facts: the <i>Home</i> was

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
212 feet long by 22 wide and 12 deep. She was nearly
18 times as long as she was deep, and she was built of
wood, at that. The engine, which was placed near the
centre, as usual, had a cylinder 56 inches in diameter, with
a stroke of 9 feet, and that is to say it was enormously
heavy for a hull of such proportions. A set of iron braces
was provided on each side to strengthen the hull, but on
the first trip they "broke loose from their sockets on deck
at their forward ends, by the elastic movement of the vessel
in a heavy sea," as W. C. Redfield, a New York engineer,
said in describing the vessel.
</p>
<p>Two voyages were made with no greater visible injury
than the breaking, on each voyage, of the worthless braces.
On November 9, 1837, as the <i>Home</i> was bound on her
third voyage, she was overtaken by a northeast gale, and
shortly after passing the Hatteras shoals, it was found
that the "elastic movement" of the hull, which, according
to Engineer Redfield, was "necessarily and properly manifested,"
had opened an uncontrollable leak. The <i>Home</i>
was then driven on the beach, where she at once went to
pieces. About a hundred lives were lost.
</p>
<p>It is important to note here that Engineer Redfield, in
writing his defence of the <i>Home</i> (1842), was entirely sincere.
Further than that, the owners of the vessel were so
confident that she was of a proper model in all respects that
the only insurance they carried upon her was for a small
sum to secure a creditor.
</p>
<p>From this story, and others of the kind to be found in

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the records, it appears that, while American designers were
then building sailing ships and inland-water steamers that
were highly profitable, they were astonishingly ignorant of
the requirements of a steamship for deep-sea navigation.
</p>
<p>In a search for the reasons for this curious condition
of affairs it is found that the success of the inland-water
steamers was the primary cause of the American failure
at sea. The men who designed the sea-going steamers had
been trained in their art by designing, first of all, steamers
for inland waters. Because these inland-water steamers
succeeded so well, it was entirely natural that similar proportions
should be given to the engines that were to be used
upon deep water. It was also natural to model the hulls
as nearly as possible like the hulls on smooth waters. At
the same time it was believed, incredible as the statement
may seem now, that an "elastic" hull&mdash;one that
bends to the lift of the waves as a rope does&mdash;was not only
swifter but safer than a stiff one.
</p>
<p>A paragraph as to the durability of the inland-water
steamers will now prove instructive. In the report of
Israel D. Andrews on "Colonial and Lake Trade" (Sen.
Ex. Doc. 112, 32 Cong. 1 Sess.), it is said (p. 665) that
"the period of the natural life of a steamboat" in use on
the inland waters of the United States at that time (1851)
was only "three and a half to four years." This statement
included the steamers in use on the Great Lakes, which
had much longer lives than those on the rivers.
</p>
<p>With all these facts in mind, one sees why the deep-water

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
American steamers failed. Led on by the success of the
river steamers, the designers turned out engines of the lightest
possible weight consistent with the greatest power, and
then bolted them fast to the frames of hulls that were
"elastic"&mdash;would yield to the waves like a rope. Not
many of these steamers went to pieces as the <i>Home</i> did;
good seamanship saved them from that fate; but neither
good seamanship nor any economy practised afloat or
ashore could make them pay dividends in the face of the
enormous expense due to the wear and tear of machinery.
Machinery built for speed could pay dividends on the inland
waters because the steamers had no competition except
that which they created among themselves, and that lasted
for short periods only. The only competitors on the river-banks
were stage-coaches and big wagons that were driven
over the worst roads in the civilized world. The inland-water
steamers charged what prices they pleased. At sea
the steamers with their unfit machinery had to compete
with the swiftest, most comfortable, and in every way the
most economical sailing packets in the world. And until
the designers had learned the requirements of a sea-going
steamship, the sailing packets won.

<h2>CHAPTER X
<br />
<span class="s08">PRIVATEERS, PIRATES, AND SLAVERS OF THE NINETEENTH
CENTURY</span>
</h2>
<p><span class="b20">W</span>HEN seen in its true light, one of the most
curious and interesting chapters in the history
of the American merchant marine is that relating
to the men who, having the might, used it to take
from those who were weaker not only property but liberty
and life; but the reader who supposes that superior ability,
natural or acquired, gives him the <i>right</i> to take more
of the good things of life than his less-favored neighbor
receives, will scarcely comprehend the facts.
</p>
<p>The fighting done by the American merchantmen who
were commissioned as privateers during the War of 1812
has been well described by our histories of the navy, but
the story of one battle is worth recalling briefly because it
may well stand in some respects for the story of the entire
fleet. On March 26, 1815, the privateer schooner <i>General
Armstrong</i>, Captain Samuel Chester Reid, anchored in
Fayal Roads, in the Azores. As night came on, a British
squadron, bound for New Orleans, came into the roads,
and on seeing the <i>Armstrong</i>, sent four boats full of men
to capture her. A well-directed broadside from the privateer

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
sent them in haste back to their ships, but a little
after midnight the enemy came again in twelve boats,
carrying more than 400 men. Each boat was armed with
a cannon. The <i>Armstrong</i> had 90 men, and she mounted
a long 24-pounder on a pivot with four 9-pounders in each
broadside.
</p>
<p>When the flotilla came within point-blank range, Captain
Reid opened a fire that would have beaten back any other
civilized enemy, but this veteran host pulled steadily in
until the boats were alongside from stem to stern, and
then they rose up, as one man, and strove to board the
low-lying schooner. But with sword and pike and battle-axe
the privateersmen fought not only for life but to avenge
the wrongs that had been suffered by American seamen
at the hands of press-gangs, and even British valor could
not face them. One of the defeated wrote that the
"Americans fought more like blood-thirsty savages than
anything else." We may believe that they were thrilled
with the joy of battle, and if a modern, peace-loving
American is ever permitted to envy any of his countrymen
who have had part in any battle described in the histories
of the nation, the men of the <i>General Armstrong</i> will come
to his mind first of all. But a liner, a frigate, and a brig
were at hand to back the boats, and at last Reid had to
burn his ship.
</p>
<p>The gallant fight and the ultimate loss stand for much
good fighting without profit in the work of our private
armed ships during the War of 1812. Our histories,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
almost without exception, have overstated the success of
the privateers and their influence upon the course of the
war. A few of these ships&mdash;a very few&mdash;made enormous
profits; the others made insignificant gains or actual
losses. Our histories laud the work of the few that really
succeeded; they ignore all that failed, save only as the
reader is left to infer that all, or nearly all, did well. Thus
the fact that the <i>Rossie</i>, of Baltimore, Captain Joshua
Barney, in a single cruise, captured vessels supposed to be
worth more than $1,500,000 is told in every history; the
equally well-authenticated fact that Barney's share of the
plunder amounted to only $1000 (see Mary Barney's
<i>Memoir</i>), because the much-vaunted prizes were either
destroyed at sea, or were sold for little or nothing in port,&mdash;this
fact is deliberately omitted.
</p>
<p>In the matter of net gains the <i>Rossie</i> stands as a type
of the successful privateers, with a few exceptions. On
November 23, 1812, less than six months after war was
declared, and while the successful privateers were securing
the best of their prizes, the privateer owners of Boston,
New York, and Norfolk united in a petition to Congress,
begging help through legislation because captured goods
sold for such low prices that no profit was made by even
the successful privateers. The captured ships, it was said,
could not be sold at any price, even when fit for use as
privateers. In short, "the profits of private naval warfare
are by no means equivalent to the hazard." (Rep. Com.
Ways and Means, December 12, p. 3.)
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
In Guernsey's <i>New York City During the War of 1812</i>
is a list of the privateers sailing from that city&mdash;120 in
all. Of these, 57 took not one prize. It is to be presumed
that 21 of them made some money, because they took at
least 5 prizes, while 7 took at least 15, and it may be supposed
that they did well. But when it is remembered that
in those days a ship commonly paid for herself in one
voyage in ordinary trade, it cannot be said that privateering
was of any special benefit except to three or four
that took many prizes.
</p>
<p>The total number of merchant ships that were used for
privateers during this war was 515, and the total number
of prizes was 1345. The British admiralty reported the
capture of 1328 American merchantmen, of which 228 were
privateers. The unrecorded disasters to privateers through
storms certainly brought the number of total losses of
these vessels up to a half of all that were commissioned.
It is notable, too, that the number of American merchantmen
captured by the enemy was only thirteen less than
the number taken from the enemy, and it follows that the
American losses were greater, in this respect, than those
of the British; for the American ships were, on the average,
worth much more than the British. On the whole it
appears that, if the predatory part of the War of 1812 had
any influence upon the result, the Americans were the
greater losers.
</p>
<p>Then, too, the losses of property were only one part
of the injury inflicted upon the country by this kind of

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
war. A consideration of the effect of the prevailing greed
for a "subject of safe and uncontested capture" is of special
interest here because some of the owners of our privateers,
influenced solely by this greed, became pirates after the
war ended. The Spanish colonists in America had revolted,
beginning in 1810. The insurgent armies were
scattered in small bands, here and there, in the vast territory
between Texas and the Rio de la Plata, and the leader
of every band was a law unto himself. But in every
revolted province some aggregation of patriots&mdash;some
<i>junta</i>&mdash;was recognized by foreign powers as enough of
a government to be entitled to belligerent rights. When
the War of 1812 came to an end, the privateers that were
loath to give up their predatory career looked away to the
Spanish main. The insurgent leaders were competent
to commission armed cruisers for war upon Spanish commerce,
and rich Spanish ships were afloat.
</p>
<p>Some of the work done by American ships sailing under
Spanish-American commissions is memorable. Two that
were owned in Baltimore brought to Norfolk, in March,
1817, coin and cochineal valued at $290,000, and there is
reason to suppose that Captain James Chaytor, who was
senior officer of the two, and one of the best known of the
men so engaged, brought to port property worth half a
million of dollars in the course of that year. One of
Chaytor's prizes was a galleon from the Philippines, and
it was taken within sight of Cadiz.
</p>
<p>Captain Joseph Almeda, of Baltimore, was another

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
noted commander of this class of cruisers. In a vessel
named the <i>Congress</i> he blockaded the port of Havana for
weeks at a stretch, and took prizes almost within range of
the Morro.
</p>
<p>For a time the American people applauded the success of
these cruisers, because it was supposed that they were aiding
struggling patriots to gain liberty. The story of one of the
cruisers, as told in court, however, in time changed public
opinion. Captain James Barnes, commanding a Baltimore
cruiser named the <i>Puerrydon</i>, with a commission from
Buenos Ayres, captured on March 21, 1818, the Spanish
brig <i>Corrunes</i>, while she was carrying general merchandise
from Tarragona, Spain, to Vera Cruz, Mexico. A prize
crew of seven men was placed upon the prize, and five
of her Spanish crew were left on board to help work ship.
On May 8 a storm separated the two vessels, whereupon
the foremast hands upon the prize mutinied, put their
officers upon a passing merchantman, and then went cruising
along the coast of the United States. They were not
bound for any particular port; they were just enjoying
life while they might. Eventually they ran ashore on
Block Island, and when the inhabitants came to the beach
to look at the stranded brig, the mutineers began trading
the cargo of the vessel for fresh provisions, and later for
coin. The islanders made such good bargains that they
sent for friends in Newport to come over and share in the
good fortune, but that was an error of judgment, because
the revenue officers thereby learned about the trading, and

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
brig, crew, and some of the traders were haled before the
United States court.
</p>
<p>The trials that followed were among the most remarkable
ever reported in the annals of the Supreme Court.
Although held in jail on the charge of piracy, the crew
libelled the vessel on the ground that they had rescued her
from Barnes, whom they denounced as a pirate. Captain
Barnes and the other owners sued for the property on the
ground that Barnes had captured it while he was a citizen
of Buenos Ayres, and in command of a lawful Buenos
Ayres cruiser. A Spanish consul sued for it in behalf
of the original owners. In the court of last resort it was
held, in spite of much perjury, that the naturalization of
Barnes in Buenos Ayres was "altogether in fraud of the
laws of his own country," and that the owners of the
cruiser were asking for the possession of a vessel that they
had captured "in violation of the most solemn stipulation
of a treaty, and provision of a law of their own country,
and of which they had been dispossessed by their own
associates in guilt."
</p>
<p>"It is a melancholy truth," continued the court, "too
well known to this court, that the instruments used in
these predatory voyages, carried on under the colors of the
South American states, are among the most abandoned
and profligate of men."
</p>
<p>Under the treaty mentioned, these American-owned
cruisers were pirates. How many cruisers of the kind
were fitted out from American ports (there were some

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
European ships in the business also) cannot be learned
now, but a list of twenty-eight is printed in the Annals
of the Fifteenth Congress. The list is incomplete. Most
of them were owned in Baltimore, and in 1823 the Columbia,
South Carolina, <i>Telescope</i> denounced that city as "the
home port of a fleet of Spanish-American pirates." In
reply to this, <i>Niles's Register</i>, dated May 24, 1823, said:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"Perhaps it may afford the editor of the <i>Telescope</i> some
satisfaction to learn that <i>every</i> person who was fully regarded
as being engaged in whatever could have given rise
to his censure for piracy has become a bankrupt as well
in character as in property."
</p>
<p>It is to be noted, further, that these cruisers were not
pirates merely by the existence of a treaty with Spain.
They captured the ships of all nations when it could be
done safely, and sometimes they did this openly. When
Almeda was blockading Havana, he seized a British vessel
at the mouth of the harbor because she happened to have
some Spanish property on board. But the most deplorable
cases were those in which the ships were seized by cruisers
that had been unlucky. For in such cases the prizes were
robbed and then sunk with all hands.
</p>
<p>Still another result of the work of these pirates was the
establishment of two remarkable communities, one in
Texas and the other in Florida, both of which territories
were then under the Spanish crown. Both settlements
were made to provide a market for the goods which these
cruisers captured; for after the decision of the courts noted

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
above, the prizes could be no longer sent to the United
States.
</p>
<p>The Texas community was established by Jean Lafitte,
who had had much experience as a smuggler at Barataria
Bay, Louisiana, both before and during the War of 1812.
He had also made several cruises on pirate ships&mdash;enough
to learn that more money could be made buying
prizes from the cruisers than in cruising.
</p>
<p>Lafitte went to the island where the thriving city of
Galveston now stands, late in 1816, and found there
a number of shanties which had been built by one Luis
de Aury, a pirate who had intended to establish such a
nautical "fence" as Lafitte had in mind. But Aury
thought the distance from the United States too great, and
left the place to Lafitte, who at once sent word to all the
ports of the warm seas that he was at the head of "an
asylum to the armed vessels of the party of independence."
The asylum included facilities for repairing vessels, stores
for the sale of supplies, and numerous taverns and other
places of resort for the crews. In short, a town&mdash;seaport&mdash;was
built there by capitalists and mechanics, but all
paid tribute to Lafitte. As at Barataria, slave-ships were
more highly prized than any others because of the ease
with which the "goods" could be smuggled into the United
States. When General James Long, a noted Texas
filibuster, visited the settlement, he found that "doubloons
were as plentiful as biscuit," while the harbor was strewn
with the wrecks of prizes.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
After a time Lafitte went through with the forms of organizing
the "Republic of Texas," and elected a governor,
who appointed a justice to preside over the court of
admiralty that the constitution of the "Republic" had
provided. Then cruisers were commissioned and prizes
were condemned, but when these condemned prizes were
sent to New Orleans, they were seized by the United States
authorities, and some of the pirate crews were hanged.
Nevertheless, it was not until 1821&mdash;after nearly five
years of unmolested prosperity&mdash;that Lafitte was driven
away, and even then he was allowed to carry away all of
his portable plunder. To add to the interest of the
story, when Lafitte left the island he disappeared forever.
Rumor said he was seen in Mexico, and in the thick of
a fight at sea, and in France, but the truth is that he had
gone to the port of missing ships. When the Luis de Aury
mentioned above left Galveston Island, he cruised around
for a while, and then, on September 2, 1817, landed on
Amelia Island, Florida, where Fernandina now stands.
A Scotch adventurer named MacGregor had been trying
to build a town there and organize the "Republic of the
Two Floridas," but without success. He sailed away
when Aury came, and Aury continued the work of nation-building,
combined with smuggling goods captured by
"the party of independence." He thought the location
admirable because of the proximity to the United States,
but he soon learned that the convenience due to distance
was more than counterbalanced by the attention attracted.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Many speculators came to the camp and bought his goods,
but the customs officials pressed them closely. Moreover,
while Aury supplied the planters with cheap slaves, he
was so short-sighted as to encourage Georgia slaves to
leave their masters to join his forces. The Georgia
planters who suffered losses in this way had no difficulty
in persuading the Washington authorities to invade Spanish
Florida and drive the pirate away&mdash;December 23,
1817. But Aury, like Lafitte, was allowed to carry away
his plunder.
</p>
<p>The effect of the piracies upon American commerce
can be traced in the annual reports of exports and imports.
Thus the exports of American products to the Spanish
West Indies amounted to $3,606,588 in the fiscal year
1816-1817, while American exports of foreign goods to
the same ports reached the sum of $3,477,511. The corresponding
figures for 1819-1820 were $3,439,365 of
American products and $2,545,717 of American exports of
foreign goods. American tonnage fell off, also, of course.
The common saying that there is no friendship in business
is untrue. American commerce and the use of American
ships were increasing in that period at an astonishing rate
in all other trades, but Spanish resentment produced a
"boycott" that is shown by the official returns.
</p>
<p>But this boycott was the mildest form of expression of
Spanish resentment. Within a short time after the
American-owned cruisers under the Spanish-American
flags began ravaging Spanish commerce, the Spaniards

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
retaliated by making reprisals after the fashion common
in the sixteenth century. Encouraged by the island
authorities, the ship-owners of Cuba fitted out armed
vessels to prey upon American commerce. The Cuban
pirates were in no case commissioned, but the Porto Rico
authorities gave commissions to half a dozen or more.
The Cuban pirates, however, worked openly. Regla,
a village on the east side of Havana Bay, was the chief
pirate port. In November, 1821, eleven Spanish pirate
vessels were cruising between Cape Maisi and Santiago,
five were working as a squadron at Cape San Antonio,
and at least five more were cruising on the north coast east
of Matanzas. Between Havana and Matanzas was a
flotilla of small boats the crews of which kept constant
watch for vessels becalmed in the offing. All such vessels
were attacked as soon as night came. Another gang
of small-boat pirates operated at Cape Cruz, where they
lived in the caves for which the region is noted.
</p>
<p>The extent of the depredations of these pirates
was never completely known, of course, but in <i>Niles's
Register</i> of May 24, 1823, it is stated that 3002 piratical
assaults had been committed upon merchant ships in the
West Indies since the War of 1812. The "Naval Affairs"
volumes of the American State Papers contain many
accounts of such assaults, and it appears from these that
the pirates not infrequently tortured captured sailors.
In March, 1823, the captain and two men of the brig
<i>Alert</i>, of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, were killed in

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
the mouth of Havana harbor. The captain of the brig
<i>Bellisaurius</i>, captured near Cape San Antonio, had his
arms cut off, after which he was placed on a bed of oakum
and burned to death.
</p>
<p>The markets of Cuba were frequently flooded with
merchandise taken by the pirates, and a number of
schooners plied between Cape San Antonio and Regla to
carry supplies to the pirate flotilla at work there and bring
back captured goods.
</p>
<p>The efforts of the Washington authorities to deal with
the situation created by the American-owned pirate ships
were, as noted, hampered at first by public sympathy for
the Spanish-American insurgents. Even after the Spaniards
began making reprisals, nothing effective was done until
May 15, 1820, when Congress provided for the building
of five swift war schooners, a force that was by no means
sufficient to cope with the evil. Other ships of the navy
were ordered to the region, and these were still further
reënforced with a flotilla of small schooners bought in
Chesapeake Bay. A number of huge rowboats were built
to destroy the pirates operating in small boats near Havana,
but the depredations continued; the aid of the Cuban
authorities was sufficient to keep the pirates at work. It
was not until the independence of the Spanish-American
republics was acknowledged, and the Spanish-American
privateers thereby lost their commissions, that piracy
came to an end in the West Indies.
</p>
<p>The last American vessel to suffer at their hands was

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
the <i>Mexico</i>, Captain John G. Butman, of Salem. She
sailed from home with $20,000 in coin, for Rio Janeiro,
on August 29, 1832. On September 20 she was captured
by the schooner <i>Panda</i>, Captain Pedro Gibert, of Havana.
After taking out the coin, Gibert fastened the crew in the
forecastle and set the <i>Mexico</i> on fire; but the crew released
themselves in time to put out the fire. The <i>Panda</i> was
captured later on the coast of Africa, a number of the
pirates were sent to Salem for trial, and Pedro Gibert
and four others were hanged. It is an interesting fact
that two members of the <i>Mexico's</i> crew lived until 1905
and one until 1908. Life at sea agreed well with the
New Englanders.
</p>
<p>As the facts thus far given show plainly, the slave-trade
had intimate relations with the pirates who operated under
the Spanish-American flags, and later with those fitted
out from Cuba; for the <i>Panda</i> cleared out from Havana
for a cargo of slaves. But she carried no trade goods;
her clearance for the African coast was merely a cover
for the real purpose in view. Still, she might have brought
a cargo of slaves to Cuba but for the interference of a
British war-ship. But the American slave-trade lasted
for thirty years after the captain of the <i>Panda</i> was hanged,
and such acts of piracy as his had long been out of fashion
in American waters.
</p>
<p>By the act of Congress dated March 2, 1807 (it passed
the House by a vote of sixty-three to forty-nine), the importations
of slaves into the United States after January 1,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
1808, was forbidden. The penalties provided included
forfeiture of the vessel, and fines, together with imprisonment,
for those involved.
</p>
<p>As this legislation had been provided for in the Constitution
of the nation, the trade in slaves was naturally
brisk in the years immediately preceding prohibition.
Thus, from January 1, 1804, to December 31, 1807,
202 ships imported 39,075 slaves into the port of Charleston,
South Carolina. Of these ships, 61 were registered at
Charleston (though generally owned elsewhere), 59 were
owned in Rhode Island, from 1 to 4 in each of several
other American ports, and 70 in England. While the
prospect of prohibition increased the importations at this
time beyond the normal, it is evident that a strong demand
for slaves existed among slave-owners. The demand was
particularly strong in the Mississippi Valley, where the
profits on cotton were enormous. This demand naturally
raised the price as soon as lawful importations came to
an end. At the same time the existence of the American
prohibitory law (England prohibited the trade at about
the same time, too) depressed the price on the coast of
Africa. Thus a premium was placed on smuggling, and
202 ships were afloat that had been engaged in the trade
to one port alone.
</p>
<p>All this is to say that while the law drove many ships
out of the trade, it added much to the profits of those that
remained in it.
</p>
<p>Because the trade was continued, an effort was made to

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
strengthen the law in 1818 by increasing the emoluments
of informers. Then, by the Act of March 3, 1819, Congress
authorized the President to use the naval ships to
intercept slavers, and finally by the Act of May 15, 1820,
all Americans engaging in the trade were declared pirates,
who should be hanged on conviction.
</p>
<p>One would be glad to believe that these laws were enacted
because the American people had become sufficiently
enlightened to appreciate the effects of the trade upon the
human race, and especially upon the white people connected
with it, but it is impossible to do so. The laws were
enacted because of a passing wave of sentiment that had
its origin in the work of the pirates herein described. In
a dim way people saw that a connection existed between
some of the pirates and the slave-trade. The slave-trade
was held responsible (properly, too) for some of the horrors
of the piracies, and while Congress was legislating against
the pirates, it was easy to get acts against the trade passed.
Moreover, the desire of the slave-owners to rid their
States of free negroes was just then giving strength to the
movement for sending those negroes to Africa&mdash;Liberia.
In short, the prohibitory laws were the result of a sort of
hysteria rather than of any real enlightenment of the American
people. In truth, we are not so enlightened even now
as to appreciate our whole duty toward the inferior race&mdash;properly
a race of children&mdash;we brought from Africa.
</p>
<p>As said, prohibiting the trade did but increase the profits
of those who disregarded the law, but a more memorable

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
result of prohibition was the effect upon the unfortunate
victims of the trade&mdash;the increase in the horrors of the
middle passage. A brief description of the ships used in
the trade will help one to understand how the slaves were
affected.
</p>
<p>The American slave-ships were usually small vessels,
say 100 feet or so long, and 10 or 12 deep. On the way
to the coast what was called the slave-deck was laid.
By means of beams, stanchions, and rough planks a temporary
deck was built 3 feet below the regular deck.
The naked slaves were placed upon this deck. In the days
of the lawful trade they were compelled to lie down on
their backs, shoulder to shoulder, with heads outboard
in a row all around the slave-deck. Then other rows of
the kind were made on the deck inside of the first row
until the deck was entirely covered. When the law prohibited
the trade, the slavers increased the number carried
to the utmost capacity of their vessels, in order to increase
the profits and cover the risks. To do this they compelled
the negroes to lie down on their sides breast to back,&mdash;"spoon
fashion,"&mdash;or else they were made to sit in rows,
breast to back, from the wall of the ship to the centre.
When sitting thus, the only air-space between the two decks
was that over the rows of shoulders and between the rows
of heads. When lying down, the air-space was greater,
but whenever the vessel heeled to the wind, those on the
lee side had to lie with their feet higher than their heads,
and when the vessel rolled to the waves all of them sawed

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
to and fro over the cracks between the unplaned deck
boards. Moreover, the slaves were kept fastened to the
deck&mdash;they were not allowed to leave their cramped
berths for any purpose save only at fixed hours, when they
were fed and, in small gangs, were taken to the upper
deck for a short airing. In storms the washing of the
waves across the deck compelled the crew to put on the
hatches and keep them on sometimes for days at a stretch.
</p>
<p>Meantime the allowance of water was a pint a day. In
short, the slave-ship was a horrible floating cesspool.
How the inhuman drivers added to the sufferings of the
wretched slaves by the use of the whip, and other means
of torture, may be suggested by one story.
</p>
<p>When the slaver <i>Brillante</i>, Captain Homans, with 600
slaves in her hold, was overhauled by British cruisers
during a calm, and Homans saw that the boats of the
cruisers would soon come to the vessel, he got the anchor
in position as if for anchoring the vessel. Then the iron
cable was stretched along the rail outside of all and held
in place by slender cords. To this chain all the slaves
were carefully secured by means of ropes and chains.
Then, just before the cruisers' boats came into view
(it was at night), the anchor was cast loose and the 600
slaves were dragged down to the bottom of the sea.
</p>
<p>To save a vessel worth at most $5000 from confiscation,
Homans murdered 600 negroes. The story is told in detail
in the <i>African Repository</i>, Vol. XXIII, p. 371.
</p>
<p>The profits in the trade are shown by the fact that slaves

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
costing from $12 to $20 on the coast of Africa sold for $350,
when delivered alive and able to walk, in Cuba. When
smuggled into the United States, they sold all the way from
$750 to $1000.
</p>
<p>Old ships of known speed were in demand. Speed was
necessary because the British government maintained
cruisers on the coast that captured and confiscated vessels
found with slaves actually on board. Our navy department
sold the schooner <i>Enterprise</i> (the second of the
name) to men in the slave-trade at a small fraction of her
value. The swift privateers of the War of 1812 were also
bought for the purpose. In later years it was the custom
to build swift vessels especially for the trade. Baltimore
and New York builders were patronized more than others,
New York having the lead in later years. The builders
always knew what trade the vessels were to enter, and
charged accordingly. No builder ever lost standing in
society because he turned out ships for this purpose. In
fact, the slave-traders were well known, and they lived
among the wealthiest society people of New York&mdash;at
the Astor House, for instance, where they were in the habit of
meeting to arrange the details of their voyages. Public
documents show that the most respected merchants of the
city were ready to go on the bonds of these slavers, when
bonds were required. A New Bedford whale-ship owner
who was convicted of fitting out one of his vessels for the
trade was afterward elected mayor of his city. Even after
the Civil War was begun, a United States district attorney&mdash;a

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
man appointed by Lincoln&mdash;was seen dining at the leading
New York restaurant with a slaver whom he should
have been prosecuting at that moment; for while the two
ate together, the slaver talked about a slave voyage that he
intended to make.
</p>
<p>Though American packets had for years controlled the
trade between the United States and Europe, and
the American clippers were making records that stirred
the whole nautical world, the flag from those proud ships
was used to cover the reeking slime in the slaver's hold, and
it was the only flag that could protect the slaver from inspection
on the African coast. These facts were well known,
but they roused not a tremor of indignation among the
American people, not one, save only in the breasts of a few
"fanatics," and the arguments of the fanatics were answered
by asking, "How would you like to have your sister
marry a nigger?"
</p>
<p>The story might well be forgotten&mdash;it would have been
omitted here but for the fact that the humiliation of it
may serve in righting wrongs as yet unheeded, or but partly
heeded, which, if less brutal, are born of the same greed and
the same disregard for human rights that made the slave-trade
possible in the United States until after the middle of
the nineteenth century.

<h2>CHAPTER XI
<br />
<span class="s08">THE HARVEST OF THE SEA BEFORE THE CIVIL WAR</span>
</h2>
<p><span class="b20">I</span>N the year 1772 the people of Marblehead, Massachusetts,
boasted that "the number of polls was 1203,"
and that the vessels of all kinds owned in the port measured
more than 12,000 tons. In 1780 the number of polls
was 544, the tonnage but 1509. Within the borders of
the town were 458 widows with 966 fatherless children.
</p>
<p>Marblehead was a type of the New England fishing villages
of the day. The nation had won freedom, but the
fishing industry from which the American merchant marine
had originated was ruined. Moreover, there was no immediate
return of prosperity after peace was declared.
The gross income of the New England cod-fishing vessels
for the year 1787 averaged but $483 each; for 1788 it was
$456 each, and for 1789 only $273. The average annual
expense during this period was $416 each, and the vessels
lost on the average $143 each during the year 1789. In
that year the fleet measured 19,185 tons. In the next year
the tonnage increased to 28,348, for the fishermen hoped
for good times following the adoption of the Constitution,
and in 1793, when the fleet received a national subsidy of
$72,965.32, the tonnage reached 50,163. But in 1794,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
although the subsidy amounted to $93,768.91, the tonnage
was only 28,671. In short, the statistics show that while
the tonnage fluctuated from year to year, there was little
prosperity for any of our fishermen in the period between
the two wars for freedom.
</p>
<p>A similar condition prevailed at Nantucket and other
whaling ports. So discouraged were the Nantucket men
that many of them migrated to England and France.
For the British and French governments, to secure them,
offered free transportation, free entry for ships and goods,
and sums of money with which to begin life anew.
Records show that no less than 149 Nantucket men commanded
English whalers before the War of 1812.
</p>
<p>The foreign aggressions of various kinds account for a
large part of the depression of the fisheries during that
unhappy period. The losses sustained by our freight carriers
at that time were more than made up by the high
freight rates received. But when the fish markets of the
West Indies and of Europe were closed by adverse legislation,
or by wars, there was no way to repair the loss except
by national subsidies, and these, when granted, proved
inadequate.
</p>
<p>There was one other loss to which too little attention
has been paid&mdash;the loss of men. The Marblehead men
who were killed during the War of the Revolution were
among the most enterprising of the coast&mdash;they were
killed because of their courage and dash. Lost ships could
be replaced in the course of one winter; the lost men were

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
not replaced until their sons became men. Then, too, the
prosperity of the carrier fleet drained away the best men
among the fishermen; for the owners of the carriers knew
where to get able seamen.
</p>
<p>After the War of 1812 the cod fleet averaged somewhat
larger than it was before the war, but the increase was not
at all commensurate with the growth of the nation. The
exports of dried fish declined instead of increasing, and in
spite of a protective tariff foreigners began (1812) to sell
pickled fish in the United States. These imports increased
steadily until 1848, when more than 100,000 barrels were
brought in, and the imports thereafter remained above that
figure. In describing the situation of these fishermen in
1848, Sabine says:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"Many crews of fishing vessels owned in Newburyport,
on settling with their owners for six and seven months' hard
toil at sea, received only about ten dollars per month; and
on this miserable pittance they were to eke out the year.
They had obtained good fares of fish, but were sufferers
from the depressed state of the market. With facts like
these before us, can we wonder that the more ambitious
young men abandon the employment at every opportunity?"
</p>
<p>The vessels in the mackerel and other fisheries were, of
course, no more prosperous, on the average, than those
fishing for cod. From first to last the fisheries of New
England are of interest in the story of the American merchant
marine chiefly because they afforded an excellent
training school for the sailor <i>of the sail</i>. It was because of

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
the school afforded that these vessels were subsidized between
1792 and 1866. The annual bounty ranged from
$1.60 to $4 per ton, according to the size of the vessel.
Pay from the national treasury at the rate of $2 per month
has also been given to the crews of fishermen in order to
create a sort of sea militia. During the Civil War many recruits
for the navy were obtained from the fishermen. Impressed
by the precedent thus afforded, and failing to distinguish
between the requirements of the old-time and the
modern man-o'-war, the Merchant Marine Commission
of 1904 proposed to pay bounties to the crews now employed
in the fisheries. Of course bounties paid to the crews
of tugs and other harbor steamers would be far more effective
for the end in view. The tenacity with which our
people cling to the idea that a modern sailor needs training
on a ship of the sail is one of the discouraging features of
the outlook for a revival of our merchant marine. No one
would suppose that a training on a Dakota wheat farm was
essential to the making of a finished hot-house florist.
</p>
<p>During the period before the Civil War the whaling fleet
was enjoying what has been called the Golden Era of its
prosperity. This fact is all the more interesting because
the prosperity was due to the character of the whalemen as
developed by their environment. Because Nantucket as
farm land could afford no more than a bare living to a small
number of people, the more ambitious residents were obliged
to look elsewhere for a career; and when they looked they
saw right whales just beyond&mdash;sometimes in&mdash;the surf.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
A storm&mdash;a seeming disaster&mdash;was the means of leading
the right whalers to go in search of sperm whales, and that
cultivated enterprise, because it took them ever farther and
farther from home.
</p>
<p>The spirit of enterprise was also cultivated by the "lay"
system of paying the crew. Every man received a share of
the oil instead of set wages. The system sharpened the
eyes of the lookout, gave strength to the arm of the man
at the oars, and cooled the nerves of the man who thrust
the lance under the shoulder-blade of the whale.
</p>
<p>When Captain James Shields reached the Brazil grounds
too late in the season, the system of "no oil, no pay" drove
him around Cape Horn in search of a new ground. When,
in 1818, Captain George W. Gardener found the grounds on
the west coast of South America barren, he boldly headed
across the unexplored Pacific in search of others&mdash;with
success. In 1819 a merchantman from China stopped at
the Sandwich Islands and told a number of whalemen there
that he had seen great schools of whales on the coast of
Japan. Thereupon the whalemen raced away for the new
grounds. In 1843 two New Bedford captains found fortune
on the coast of Kamchatka and another in the
Okhotsk sea. Two years later still, Captain Royce, of the
Sag Harbor bark <i>Superior</i>, entered the Arctic by way of
Bering's Strait.
</p>
<p>The countries of Europe sent naval squadrons at great
expense to explore the Seven Seas; the whalemen of America
explored the waters of the whole world more thoroughly,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
if less scientifically, at their own expense, and made
money in the quest. One volume of the American State
Papers contains a list of more than 400 islands that were
discovered by them in the Pacific alone.
</p>
<p>Of less importance in its influence, perhaps, but not to be
overlooked, was the ease with which the ambitious whalemen
obtained promotion. The larger whalers carried
three and sometimes four mates, together with a petty
officer called a boat steerer for each of the boats. Because
the boat steerer hurled the harpoon, his office was important,
and many a daring youth who went afloat as a green
hand came home wearing the boat steerer's badge. Last of
all, but most important in its formation of character, was
the danger of the pursuit. The whalers braved the jaws
of the vicious sperm bull; they drove their boats under
the uplifted flukes, and with a stroke of a boat spade disabled
the monster. They pulled to the tune of "A dead
whale or a stove boat," and so "made good" in the world's
work naturally and easily.
</p>
<p>The Golden Era began with the success of the whalers
that sailed for the Pacific in 1815, and returned well loaded
in 1817. In 1829 the whaling fleet numbered 203 vessels;
in 1840, 552; in 1846 there were 680 ships and barks, 34
brigs, and 22 schooners, a total of 736 vessels, hunting the
whale under the American flag. New London owned the
largest ship of the fleet, the <i>Atlantic</i>, measuring 699 tons,
and the smallest, the schooner <i>Garland</i>, of 49 tons, that was
at work on the coasts of Desolation Island.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
In 1835 the value of the annual product of the whalers
exceeded for the first time $6,000,000. In 1845 the sperm-whale
fishery reached its highest point in the amount of
product&mdash;4,967,550 gallons. The price was then 88
cents a gallon. In 1855 the price was $1.772 per gallon,
but the amount saved was only 2,228,443 gallons. Right
whale-oil reached record figures in 1840, when the amount
saved was 11,593,483 gallons. The price was then 33
cents. The highest income received by the whalers in
any one year was in 1854, when the take sold for
$10,802,594.20. The years 1854 to 1857, inclusive, paid the
whalers $51,063,659.59. The average catch was worth
about half the estimated value of the fleet, or say near
the actual value. It is certain that a well-handled whaler
was a most profitable ship until after the petroleum industry
was developed.
</p>
<p>A picturesque offshoot of the whaling fleet was the fleet
of seal-hunters that came into existence at the end of the
eighteenth century. When Captains Gamaliel Collins and
David Smith, of Cape Cod, went to the Falklands (1774)
in search of whales, they found there thousands of seals,
both hair and fur, and sea-lions without end. The oil of
these animals being of good quality, the whalers carried
some of it home, together with the skins, which were found
to serve well for covering trunks. The fur-seals as well as
the hair sealskins were used for this purpose. Soon after
the War of the Revolution a Mrs. Haley, of Boston, sent
a large ship to the Falklands especially for seals. The

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
number taken was 13,000, and the skins sold for fifty cents
each in New York. This voyage, like that of the <i>Columbia</i>
to the Northwest coast, shows well the extraordinary enterprise
of the ship-owners of the day.
</p>
<p>In 1790 Elijah Austin, of New Haven, sent two vessels
to the Falklands for seals, and when they were filled, Captain
Daniel Greene, who commanded one of them, took his
cargo direct to Canton for sale, because the skins Mrs.
Haley's ship had taken had been exported from New York
to Canton with profit.
</p>
<p>The work of the brig <i>Betsey</i>, of Stonington, Connecticut,
is perhaps the most memorable of any of the ships that
entered the early trade. Though of but 100 tons' measurement,
she made two voyages to the southern seal islands,
beginning in 1790, both of which were remarkably profitable&mdash;the
better voyage paid $52,300 net. The outfit,
vessel included, probably cost little more than a tenth of
this sum.
</p>
<p>The <i>Betsey's</i> success naturally increased the number of
vessels in the hunt very rapidly. Mas-a-Fuera, Juan Fernandez,
the South Shetlands, the Prince Edward and
Crozet islands, Desolation and Heard's islands, all soon
became as well known to the sealers as Long Island Sound
was to the coasters. Captain Henry Fanning, of the ship
<i>Catharine</i>, obtained a manuscript copy of the notes made
by the original discoverer of Crozet's Island, and with that
as a guide went to the islands and obtained a full cargo.
</p>
<p>The most famous of the American seal-hunters was Captain

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
N. B. Palmer, born in Stonington, Connecticut. In
1799 he began his career afloat as the cabin-boy of a coaster
at the age of fourteen. At nineteen he was made second
mate of the brig <i>Hersilia</i>, Captain J. P. Sheffield, bound
from Stonington to the Falklands in search of seals. On
reaching the Falklands, Palmer and a number of sailors
were landed to search the group for seals, while Captain
Sheffield went south to search for another group. According
to a story told by "gaming" parties on the whalers of
the day, a whale-ship that, in spite of a heavy fog, was
cruising through the waters to the south of the Falklands,
had sailed out of the fog unexpectedly, and found herself
almost on top of a mountainous group of islands, the outlying
rocks and the beaches of which were alive with seals.
The crew of the ship, animated by the danger of their position,
hastily tacked and sailed away. Then the fog enclosed
them again, and when the captain thought to chart
the strange group he had to guess at the position. Sheffield
was in search of this group.
</p>
<p>A few days after he was left at the Falklands, Palmer saw
the brig <i>Espirito Santo</i> (owned by Englishmen at Buenos
Ayres) come to the anchorage in search of water; and
when she was anchored, Palmer noted that she carried
a sealing outfit. Thereupon he made friends with the
mate, and although sealers had the habit of keeping their
destination secret, he learned that the brig was bound for
the uncharted islands; also the course she was to steer from
the Falklands. Accordingly, when the <i>Hersilia</i> returned

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
unsuccessful, Palmer was able to follow the <i>Espirito Santo</i>
to the new group. These islands are now known as the
South Shetlands.
</p>
<p>In the following year (1820) thirty sealers gathered at
the South Shetlands, including five belonging to the Stonington
South Sea Company. One of the five was the <i>Hero</i>
("but little rising forty tons," according to one old account),
of which young Palmer was captain.
</p>
<p>While working the group, Captain Isaac Pendleton, commodore
of the five vessels mentioned, on climbing a mountain,
saw what he thought was the loom of land far away
to the south, and in the hope of finding other rookeries,
sent Palmer in the <i>Hero</i> exploring.
</p>
<p>Land was found, and Palmer soon discovered that it
was of continental dimensions. As no seals were found, he
finally headed back for the Shetlands, but before he had
crossed the intervening water a heavy fog shut him in and
he hove to. During the night a ship's bell was heard striking
the hour off the port bow, and the stroke was followed by
another off to starboard. To the crew these sounds seemed
supernatural, for they could not think that real ships were
there; but when morning came, they found the <i>Hero</i> lying
between two war-ships. The story, as told by Captain
E. Fanning, of Stonington, to Secretary of the Navy J. N.
Reynolds, in a letter written in 1828, is as follows:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"The two discovery ships sent out by the late Emperor
Alexander, of Russia, being between the South Shetlands
and Palmer Land, were becalmed in a thick fog; when the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
fog cleared away they were surprised to find one of the
Stonington South Sea Company's barques, a little vessel of
about fifty tons, between the two discovery ships, which
immediately run up the United States flag, when the frigate
and sloop of war set theirs, and the Russian Commodore
despatched a boat and officer, with an invitation to Capt.
Palmer, of the American vessel, to come on board, which
he readily accepted.
</p>
<p>"When he arrived on the commodore's deck he was
asked what islands those were in sight, and if he had any
knowledge of them. 'Yes, sir,' replied Capt. Palmer,
'those are the Shetland Islands. I am well acquainted
with them, and a pilot here. I belong, sir, to a fleet of
five sail out of Stonington, under the command of Capt.
B. Pendleton, whose ship is now at anchor in a good harbor
in that island; and if you wish for water and refreshments, I
will pilot you in, and my commodore will be much pleased
to render you any assistance.' 'I kindly thank you,' said
the Russian, 'but previous to being enveloped in the fog we
had sight of those islands, and concluded we had made a
new discovery; and behold when the fog lifts, to our utter
surprise, a beautiful little American vessel, to all appearance
in as fine order as if she had but yesterday left her
port in the United States, is discovered alongside of my
ships, the master of which readily offers to pilot my vessels
into port, where <i>his commodore</i> will tender me every aid
for refreshment! We must surrender the palm of enterprise
to you Americans,' said the Russian commodore.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
'Sir, you flatter me,' replied the American captain; 'but
there is an immense extent of land to the south, and when
the fog is entirely cleared away, you will have from your
masthead a fine sight of its mountains.' 'Indeed,' observed
the commodore, 'you Americans are a people that
will be before us; and here is, now, in your information,
and in what is now before my eyes, an example and pattern
of the oldest nation in Europe. Where I expected to
make new discoveries I find the American flag, a fleet and
a pilot!'"
</p>
<p>The commodore then arose from his seat, and placing his
hand upon Palmer's shoulder, continued:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"I name the land, which you have discovered, Palmer
Land, in your honor. But what will my august master
say, and what will he think of my two years' cruising in
search of land that has been discovered by a boy in a sloop
but little larger than the launch of my frigate?"
</p>
<p>The land thus named was a part of the Antarctic Continent.
</p>
<p>Among the interesting stories of the sealers found in
Goode's <i>Fishery Industries of the United States</i> is one
of the ship <i>Neptune</i>, Captain Daniel Greene, of New
Haven, which shows very well something of the peculiarities
of this branch of the American merchant marine. The
voyage lasted from November 29, 1796, to July 11, 1799.
</p>
<p>The <i>Neptune</i> was a ship of 353 tons, and she carried a
crew of 36 all told. Going to the Cape de Verde Islands,
Captain Greene bought enough salt to preserve all the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
skins the ship could carry, and then went to the Falklands,
where he arrived February 22, 1797. The first work done
there was the building of a shallop for working shoal waters.
Then seal-hunting was begun in connection with the crew
of a ship from Hudson, New York, which, by the way, had
brought a Hudson River sloop as a tender.
</p>
<p>The seals were found either on beaches which the
hunters reached easily, or on outlying rocks upon which the
seas broke with tremendous fury even in the most pleasant
weather. Ordinary whale-boats were commonly used in
hunting the seals, though dories were preferred for the
least accessible rocks. When the weather was at its best,
the crews worked the easily reached beaches; incredible
as it must seem, it was during the worst storms that the
almost inaccessible rocks were visited. The most picturesque
and daring work known to the sea was that of taking
seals on these rocks. Rowing well out to windward, the
officer in command of the boat noted carefully the position
of the sunken reefs with which all these rocks were surrounded,
selected a safe opening, and waited until the high
waves that always come in threes appeared. Upon the
crest of the last of a set of these the boat was driven in, and
as it was swept along beside the rock the hunters, with
clubs in hand, leaped forth to land as best they might.
</p>
<p>At other times the boat was rowed up from the lee side
to meet the crest of a roller at the side of the rock. The
method chosen depended upon the situation of the rock.
</p>
<p>Taking the men from the rocks after the killing was often

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
more dangerous, if less picturesque, than landing them.
For it was impossible to hold the boat beside the rock, and
in leaping out the men often fell into the sea. A favorite
way of getting men and dead seals was by throwing a line
from the boat to the rock and then, while the boat was
held in the lee of the rock, the men and carcasses were
dragged through the water by the line.
</p>
<p>The crews were continually drenched; the cold winds
pierced them to the bone; they fell upon the rocks and were
cut and bruised; now and then one fell, helpless, into the
sea and was drowned. But the crews of those days were
composed of youths who were looking ahead,&mdash;the most
ambitious and courageous of all who lived around the
home port,&mdash;and without flinching they took the chances
until the ship was loaded.
</p>
<p>These were the American fur-hunters of the sea. Rarely
if at all elsewhere in the history of the nation can a more instructive
contrast be found than that afforded when these
men, leaping from the crest of the storm-waves to the seal
rocks, are compared with those who traded pot-metal
muskets and adulterated rum to the Indians in exchange
for beaver skins upon the Western frontier.
</p>
<p>Another glimpse of life at sea in those days is found in an
adventure of the <i>Neptune's</i> men upon the coast of Patagonia.
Captain Greene and some of his men went over
there looking for seals, and found some Spaniards engaged
in seal-hunting not far from Port Desire. The Spaniards
said the <i>commandante</i> of the fort at the harbor would be

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
pleased to give Greene permission to hunt seals in the
region, and Greene, being a law-abiding man, went to the
fort to see about the matter.
</p>
<p>The <i>commandante</i>, however, pretended to believe that
Greene was an Englishman; and as England and Spain
were at war, the Americans were all held as prisoners,
while soldiers were placed in charge of the shallop in which
the Americans had come to the coast. As it appeared
later, it was to get possession of the shallop that the <i>commandante</i>
had decided that Americans were Englishmen.
</p>
<p>Greene, however, was equal to the emergency. When
the priest at the fort gathered the garrison into the chapel
at 8 o'clock for the evening services, Greene overpowered
the sentinels, ran out of the gate with his men, launched
his whale-boat, rowed off to the shallop, set the soldiers
ashore, and sailed away.
</p>
<p>The <i>Neptune</i>, like all American vessels of the period,
carried cannon. After seeing that his guns were in service
condition, Greene returned to Port Desire and anchored
in the harbor just out of range of the fort, and began to take
seals from the rocks. The <i>commandante</i> came down the
beach, and with much gesticulation (and nothing more
effective) ordered him away. Greene might have defied
him, but instead of doing so sent the purser to offer him the
shallop (which was no longer needed) for permission in
writing to go on with the hunt. The offer was gladly
accepted, and Greene cleaned the coast of seals.
</p>
<p>Greene's way of dealing with the official is especially interesting

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
because it was characteristic of the American sea
captains of the day in their intercourse with bumptious
officials everywhere.
</p>
<p>Then the <i>Neptune</i> went to Juan Fernandez and Mas-a-Fuera,
where the cargo was completed.
</p>
<p>"During the latter part of the time ... we frequently
stove our boats in the surf," says a letter written
by Purser Eben Townsend, and that is the extent of his
comment on the dangers of landing on outlying rocks in
the midst of a gale.
</p>
<p>On June 9, 1798, the <i>Neptune</i> sailed for Canton, where
she sold her skins for $2 each, and used the proceeds in
buying China goods. This cargo, on reaching New York,
paid customs duties amounting to $55,438.71, and sold for
$260,000. The foremast hands received a "lay" of $1200
each. A paragraph in one of Purser Townsend's letters
regarding these foremast hands is worth quoting:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"Many of our crew were very smart, ambitious young
men.... In our voyage across the Pacific they exerted
themselves to be qualified for commanding ships, and
the captain gave them as much indulgence as he could
for that object, allowing them time and giving them instruction.
It was quite a regular good school on board,
and the progress was even greater than in some literary
institutions on shore. Some men that could not do a sum
in addition when we left America could now work lunar
observations."
</p>
<p>By 1825 the seals were so nearly exterminated that the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
hunt for skins gave no profit, but the amount of sea-lion
oil that could be secured was sufficient to keep a fleet cruising
in southern seas until 1870, when three vessels fitted
once more for a skin hunt and secured 8000. The next
year eight vessels obtained 15,000 good fur seals, and in
1876 Captain Athearn, in the schooner <i>Florence</i>, took a
cargo that sold for $100,000. Between 1871 and 1880 the
number of skins taken was 92,756. After that date the
hunt again became unprofitable, but the sea-lion oil kept a
few vessels busy for some years. The year 1880 may be
called the last of the employment of the American seal-hunting
fleet.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>

<h2>CHAPTER XII
<br />
<span class="s08">THE PACKET LINES AND THE CLIPPERS</span>
</h2>
<p><span class="b20">T</span>WO results of the War of 1812 are of especial
interest here. Through good fighting the American
ship was at last free to sail upon the high
seas unmolested by any power upon earth, and the seafaring
people had become aggressive to a degree that was
little short of bumptious. In the weary years that had
passed since the <i>Trial</i> sailed from Boston, our sailors had
been engaged in a struggle for mere existence; now they
were to enter with eager zest into a contest for the supremacy
of the seas.
</p>
<p>The first work done to this end was the establishment of
a packet line (1816) from New York to Liverpool, by
Jeremiah Thompson, Isaac Wright, Benjamin Marshal,
and other capitalists of New York under the name of the
Black Ball Line. It may interest students of psychology
to know that the Quaker religious element prevailed among
the stockholders.
</p>
<p>The word "packet" had been used theretofore at sea
only in connection with certain small but swift vessels
(usually brigs) that the British government employed to
carry the mail to foreign countries. These vessels sailed

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
from the home port at regular intervals, and the weather
was bad indeed when one of them failed to get away at the
advertised hour.
</p>
<p>In connection with the Liverpool packet service it is
important to recall the difference between loading a ship
"on owners' account," and carrying freight for any shipper
at a rate per ton. The earliest American ships usually
carried cargo that belonged to the owners and crews. The
ships of Derby's time carried goods partly for the owners
and partly for "adventurers," who paid the owners a
freight rate. With the further growth of commerce the
amount of freight offered for transportation by merchants
who owned no ships had increased rapidly, and before, as
well as after, the War of 1812 there were ship-owners who
made increasing profits by catering to these merchants.
The owners of these vessels, it appears, had observed that
the regularity of the Hudson River packets had increased
the freight and passenger traffic there in a far greater ratio
than any one would have anticipated from the growth of
population; and this fact led to the conclusion that if a
regular day of despatch, with the utmost speed, were provided
for the New York-Liverpool trade (the trade in
which the freighting traffic was largest), the ships would
be able to command the best part of the commerce. The
event justified the venture; the Black Ball Line was profitable
from first departure. The ships were even able to
command higher rates than the ordinary vessels.
</p>
<p>The ships employed were among the largest and swiftest

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
of the period (400 to 500 tons each), and the captains were
under orders to drive them to the limit. The passages
from Sandy Hook to Liverpool during the first 9 years
were made on the average in 23 days, the shortest time
being 15 days and 18 hours&mdash;made by the <i>New York</i>
in 1822. The westward passage during that time was
made in 40 days on the average.
</p>
<p>In 1821 the Red Star Line (Byrnes, Grimble, &amp; Co.)
entered the Liverpool service with a ship every month on
the 24th&mdash;a week ahead of the Black Ball Line. To meet
this competition the Black Ball began sending ships away
on the 16th as well as the first, and then the Swallow
Tail Line (Thaddeus Phelps &amp; Co., and Fish, Grinnell,
&amp; Co.) made the service weekly.
</p>
<p>In 1821 Thomas Cope &amp; Son began a monthly service
from Philadelphia to Liverpool, and in 1823 the Swallow
Tail Line began sending ships monthly to London. This
last service soon had opposition in a line established by
John Griswold. Then between 1822 and 1832 three lines
were successfully established between New York and
Havre.
</p>
<p>The success of the transatlantic lines led to the formation
of coastwise lines. A number of 180-ton sloops
made regular passages from New York to Boston, beginning
in 1818. In 1825 packets began running from New
York to Charleston; the New Orleans line was opened
in 1832, and at the same time another line began running
to Vera Cruz, Mexico. These lines added much to the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
offerings of freight and passengers to the transatlantic lines,
and helped the growth of New York immensely.
</p>
<p>The New Orleans and the Vera Cruz lines were owned
by E. K. Collins, a man of much importance in the history
of the American merchant marine, as shall appear. His
success in these two lines led him to sail into the Liverpool
trade with what was known as the Dramatic Line. The
New York <i>Daily Advertiser</i>, in announcing this line
(September, 1836), said:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"We notice this new enterprise with pleasure, as it will
add another list of fine ships to the sixteen now built.
The ships are all to be 800 tons and upward, New York
built. The Liverpool lines are composed of 20 ships or
about 14,000 tons.... Nor will the establishment of
another line injure in the slightest degree the other lines&mdash;the
more facilities there are afforded the more goods
and passengers will be transported."
</p>
<p>The number of ships in the packet fleets, as here noted,
is worth consideration, for if the ships of the lines to London
and to Havre and that from Philadelphia be added,
the whole number was no more than 50, the tonnage of
which was less than 35,000. In that year the American
tonnage in the foreign traffic was 753,094. The packet
fleets contained but a small fraction of the American
tonnage, but their influence upon the contest for supremacy
of the seas was wonderful.
</p>
<p>The files of the newspapers of the day give many glimpses
of the packet ships as the reporters saw them. Thus the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Liverpool Courier, of March 24, 1824, in describing the
500-ton <i>Pacific</i>, Captain S. Maxwell, said:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"This fine vessel has, during the week, been crowded
with visitors who have viewed with feelings of admiration
the splendid style in which her cabins are fitted up.
Her dining room is 40 feet by 14. A mahogany table
runs down the centre, with seats on each side formed of
the same wood and covered with black hair cloth. The
end of the dining room aft is spanned by an elliptical arch,
supported by handsome pillars of Egyptian porphyry.
The sides of the cabin are formed of mahogany and satin
wood, tastefully disposed in pannels and most superbly
polished. The doors of the staterooms are very neat, the
compartments in each being inlaid with a square of plate
glass. An arch extends over the entrance to each room,
supported by delicate pillars of beautiful white Italian
marble, exquisitely polished. The staterooms are seven
on each side; they are fitted up with much taste, and with
a studious regard of the comfort and convenience of the
passengers. The sideboard is placed in a recess in the end
of the cabin. An arch is thrown over it by two pillars of
American marble from the state of Vermont.... The
<i>Pacific</i> is built of live oak, copper fastened, and is now
coppering in No. 2 Graving-Dock. Nothing can exceed
the politeness of Captain Maxwell in showing her to the
public."
</p>
<p>In 1838 the New York <i>Express</i>, in describing "the last
new packet," said:&mdash;
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
"We recollect that thirty years ago, when the <i>Manhattan</i>
was launched&mdash;she was about 600 tons burden&mdash;all
New York crowded down to see her. She was the wonder
of the day; and it was then believed that she was the
<i>ne plus ultra</i> in ship building; that she was not only the
largest and finest ever built, but that ever could be built.
From that day to this they have gone on improving and
building until they have now got to a point of perfection
that one would hardly suppose could be excelled. Our
ships, and particularly our packets, are admired by all
nations wherever they go; and although we do not admit
that we cannot, by our skill, ingenuity and capital, go on
improving, the world admits that America is without a
rival in the noble art of building this description of vessel.
</p>
<p>"We have, from time to time, given descriptions of the
various ships that have been put afloat.... We have
now another to add&mdash;the ship <i>Roscius</i>, built by E. K.
Collins, belonging to the Dramatic Line, and to be commanded
by Captain John Collins. She is the largest that
has yet been built, and for strength and beauty is a noble
specimen of American ship building. The following
are her dimensions:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"Burden, 1100 tons; length of main deck, 170 feet;
length of spar deck, 180 feet; breadth of beam, 36½ feet;
depth of hold, 22 feet; height of cabin, 6½ feet; height from
keelson to main truck, 187 feet; length of main yard, 75 feet."
</p>
<p>Of the velvet used upon the sofas, and the Wilton carpets,
the "scarlet marino" drapery, "with white curtains,"

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
nothing more need be said, but the facts that she cost
$100,000 ($90 per ton) and would "stow about 3200 bales
of cotton" are, perhaps, memorable.
</p>
<p>With a little imagination a picture that warms the blood
is found in the following brief paragraph from a Liverpool
paper published in July, 1836:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"<i>Ship Race.</i>&mdash;Twelve ships sailed from New York
for Liverpool on the 8th instant. Among them were
the packet ships Sheffield, Allen; the Columbus, Palmer;
and the George Washington, H. Holdredge, and several
first-rate vessels, the Star, the Congress, the Josephine, &amp;c.
Heavy bets were laid on the respective ships at the time of
sailing. The three packet ships having parted company,
fell in with each other on the Banks of Newfoundland.
Here they parted. The George Washington passed
Holyhead on Saturday forenoon; two or three hours afterwards
the Sheffield passed the same place. Both ships
entered the Mersey in the course of the afternoon, after a
run of seventeen days from port to port. The Columbus
arrived yesterday morning. None of the other ships have
yet appeared."
</p>
<p>Fancy a newspaper giving no more space than that to
such a magnificent race! Still, races of the kind were
common in those days, and the sailor can imagine how the
ships were handled. The Palmer who commanded the
Columbus, by the way, was Nathaniel Brown Palmer, who
discovered the Antarctic Continent while in command of
the <i>Hero</i>&mdash;"a little rising forty tons."
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>

<p class="caption"><a id="Ill9"></a><span class="smcap">Clipper Ship <i>SYREN</i></span>
</p>
</div>
<p>In 1837 the papers announced that the <i>Sheffield</i>, Captain
Allen, that came in second in the race had, within
the past 12 months, made the eastward passage five
times in succession in an aggregate of 91 days, "being
an average of about 18 days each from port to port."
In her next passage out she crossed in 16 days, thus
creating a record of six passages in 103 days, "being a
little over 17 days each."
</p>
<p>On April 24, 1836, the Liverpool <i>Albion</i>, under the
heading "Unprecedented Quick Passage," told how the
<i>Independence</i>, Captain E. Nye, had "sailed from New York
on the evening of the 8th instant, and the interval between
her leaving and taking the Liverpool pilot was only
<i>fourteen days</i> and five hours."
</p>
<p>"The passage from port to port has frequently been
made in sixteen days; in the year 1822 the packet ship
<i>New York</i> made it in fifteen days and three-quarters;
but the <i>Independence</i> is the only ship that ever accomplished
it within the fifteen days."
</p>
<p>The passengers on the <i>Independence</i>, "being desirous
of commemorating the unparalleled short passage," appointed
a committee to "procure and convey" to Captain
Nye "a Piece of Plate with a suitable inscription."
</p>
<p>The <i>Independence</i> measured only 734 tons. She was
built in New York in 1834.
</p>
<p>In the course of the packet period five other liners made
passages to Liverpool in fourteen days or less&mdash;the
<i>Montezuma</i>, the <i>Patrick Henry</i>, the <i>Southampton</i>, the <i>St.</i>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
<i>Andrew</i>, and the <i>Dreadnought</i>. Under Captain Samuel
Samuels the <i>Dreadnought</i> was the most famous of them
all. She ran in the St. George's line&mdash;A. Taylor &amp; Co.
Samuels was born in Philadelphia, on March 14, 1823.
He ran away to sea when eleven years old, and at twenty-one,
after a venturesome career, was placed in command
of a ship called the <i>Angelique</i>. In 1853 the <i>Dreadnought</i>
(1413 tons) was built especially for him, and as he told
the writer she was a ship of "medium full lines." And
yet in her first voyage to Liverpool and back<a id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor"><sup>[7]</sup></a> she reached
Sandy Hook just as the Cunard steamer <i>Canada</i>, which
had left Liverpool one day ahead of her, was arriving at
Boston.
</p>
<p>On Saturday, February 9, 1856, the Liverpool <i>Chronicle</i>,
under the head lines "Important from America. Five
days later&mdash;Arrival of the <i>Dreadnought</i>," said:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"The clipper <i>Dreadnought</i>, Captain Samuels, ...
arrived here this forenoon from New York after a rapid
passage of fourteen days and eight hours."

Liverpool, 3000 miles, in 13 days and 8 hours. And in

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
1860 he ran from Sandy Hook to Queenstown, a distance
of 2760 miles, in 9 days and 17 hours, a record never
equalled either before or since.
</p>
<p>"She was on the rim of a cyclone, most of the time,"
said the captain in describing the passage to the writer.
The sailors of the day called her the "Wild Boat of the
Atlantic," and some unremembered forecastle bard wrote a
song of nine stanzas about her, of which the first was:&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"It is of a flash packet,</p>
<p class="i1">A packet of fame.</p>
<p>She is bound to New York</p>
<p class="i1">And the <i>Dreadnought's</i> her name.</p>
<p>She is bound to the west'ard</p>
<p class="i1">Where the stormy winds blow.</p>
<p>Bound away in the <i>Dreadnought</i>,</p>
<p class="i1">To the west'ard we'll go."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Seafaring people are yet alive who well remember the
boisterous vigor with which the old-time sailors used to roar
out "Bound away in the <i>Dreadnought</i>, To the west'ard
we'll go," wherein all the crew joined the chanty man.
</p>
<p>The counting-house view of the packets must not be
overlooked. The earliest ships cost about $40,000, or
say $80 a ton measurement. The later ones cost nearer
$90 a ton, the <i>Roscius</i>, of 1100 tons, as noted above, costing
$100,000. The captain usually owned an eighth of his
ship, and many a man of good reputation who lacked the
money to buy such a share was allowed to buy in with a
note that was paid off with his share of the earnings.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
The captain, who was part owner, naturally handled the
ship with greater economy on that account. The salary
of the captain was usually $360 a year, but in addition
he had 5 per cent of the freight money, a fourth of the
cabin passage money, all the money paid for carrying
mails (twopence a letter from the British government,
and two cents from the American), and the privilege of
carrying his wife board free. On the whole, these captains
made not far from $5000 a year.
</p>
<p>The number of cabin passengers varied from 30 in the
earlier days up to 80 in the later, though there were many
passages, of course, when the cabin was nearly empty.
The price of passage was $140 during most of the time,
but competition cut it to $100, now and then. The owners,
however, calculated on an income of from $2000 to $5000
per passage from the cabin. The income from freights
ran from $5000 to $10,000 per passage. Each ship made
six passages a year. Much larger sums were earned in
a single passage at times. The <i>Orient</i>, Captain George
S. Hill, once made a gross income of $50,000 for a round
voyage, while the <i>Webster</i>, Captain Joseph J. Law, made
$60,000.
</p>
<p>The proudest seafaring man in the world at that period
was the master of a Liverpool packet. When the wind
served at the hour of sailing, he set all plain sail on his
vessel as she lay at her pier, laid all flat aback, drove her
stern first into the stream, turned her around, and then,
while the spectators cheered themselves hoarse, he sent

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
her rippling down to the sea. And when he returned he
sometimes arrived in the river with royals set and sailed
her into her berth with less fuss and jar than the ferryboat
in the near-by slip was making. Indeed, tugs were
used before 1835 only when the wind was foul or wholly
lacking, and for years after that it was a matter of pride
as well as profit to save the tug bill ($140) whenever
possible.
</p>
<p>Most of the newspapers that have been quoted in this
chapter were printed in England. It is a significant
fact that the English papers, which represented the attitude
of the English merchants of the day, gave the American
packets unstinted praise. The acrid jealousy that
English merchants had shown during all the long years
before the War of 1812 was silenced. How did it happen
that these "Yankee" seamen were treated so well?
</p>
<p>The British House of Commons having appointed a
committee in 1835 "to inquire into the cause of shipwrecks
in the British merchant service," the London <i>Courier</i>,
on August 18 and 20, 1836, printed a number of extracts
from the committee's report. One of the paragraphs in
that report is of special interest:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"45. <i>American Shipping.</i>&mdash;That the committee cannot
conclude its labor without calling attention to the fact,
that the ships of the United States of America, frequenting
the ports of England, are stated by several witnesses to
be superior to those of a similar class amongst the ships of
Great Britain, <i>the commanders and officers being generally</i>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
<i>considered to be more competent</i> as seamen and navigators,
and more uniformly persons of education, than the commanders
and officers of British ships of a similar size and
class, trading from England to America; while the <i>seamen</i>
of the United States are considered to be more carefully
selected and <i>more efficient</i>; that American ships
sailing from Liverpool to New York, have preference
over English vessels sailing to the same port, <i>both as to
freight and to rate of insurance</i>; and <i>higher wages being
given</i>, their whole equipment is maintained in a higher
state of perfection, so that fewer losses occur; and as the
American shipping have increased of late years in the
proportion of 12¾ per cent per annum while the British
shipping have increased within the same period 1½ per
cent per annum," the superior growth of the American
merchant marine, as well as the higher wages paid, was
taking the best of the British sailors into the service of the
American ships.
</p>
<p>All of this is to say that while only twenty-one years
had elapsed since the American sailor had won, by good
fighting, the right to cross the seas unmolested by foreign
war-ships, his chief competitors openly acknowledged
that in the trade between New York and Liverpool (the
most important trade route in the world) he had won
unquestioned and even uncontested supremacy. The
American packets received cordial praise in Liverpool
because no British ship-owner so much as thought about
entering into competition with them, and this, too, at a

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
time when the British tonnage, in the aggregate, was
far greater than that of the United States.
</p>
<p>In the meantime the American whalemen had won supremacy,
as already noted, in the work of gathering the
harvest of the deep seas, and the most splendid conquest
of all, the supremacy of the sea in the trade of the Far East,
was at hand.
</p>
<p>The most interesting feature of this contest was the
evolution of a class of ships called clippers. Curiously
enough, it appears that one aggressive naval architect,
John W. Griffiths, of New York, was responsible for the
introduction of this remarkable type of ships. Griffiths
was of the opinion that a ship having "hollow" or concave
water-lines, especially at the bow,&mdash;"hollow entrance
lines,"&mdash;would sail more swiftly than one with ordinary
convex lines, no matter how fine the convex lines might
be. In 1841 Griffiths exhibited a model of a ship shaped
according to his ideas, at the American Institute, and he
also delivered a number of lectures on the subject. The
nautical world became greatly interested, and in 1843
William H. Aspinwall ordered a ship of 750 tons built
to designs by Griffiths. She was named the <i>Rainbow</i>,
and when sent, under Captain John Land, to Canton on
her maiden voyage, she arrived back at the end of 6
months and 14 days. In another voyage she sailed to Canton
in 92 days and made the passage home in 88, breaking
the record each way.
</p>
<p>The <i>Howqua</i>, the <i>Samuel Russell</i>, and the <i>Sea Witch</i>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
were also built to the new designs,&mdash;the clipper model,
as it soon came to be called,&mdash;and all made swift passages.
The <i>Russell</i> is of special interest because she was commanded
by Captain N. B. Palmer, who now left the packet
service to engage in that of the Far East. His first run was
made to Hongkong in 114 days, which was slow time for
a racer, but in the course of the voyage he covered 318
miles in a day; and in 30 consecutive days he sailed
6722 miles. To complete Palmer's record it may be said
here that in his last ship, the <i>Orient</i>, he covered 328 sea
miles in a day, and made the run home from Canton in
81 days.
</p>
<p>The <i>Howqua's</i> best work was the run from Shanghai
to New York in 88 days. The <i>Water Witch</i>, called "the
swiftest ship of her day," was commanded by Captain
Robert H. Waterman ("Captain Bob"). She set the
pace when she sailed from New York on December 23,
1846. In 25 days she hove to off Rio Janeiro long enough
to send mail ashore on an inbound ship, and in 104 days
she reached Hongkong. Her return run from Canton was
made in 81 days. In the next voyage she returned from
Canton in 77 days, her best day's run being 358 sea miles,
something then unheard of.
</p>
<p>There were a number of other celebrated clippers in
the China trade, but none of them was swifter than the
<i>Shooting Star</i>, with a passage record of 88 days from
Canton, and the <i>Atlanta</i> with a record of 84; none
equalled Waterman's passage of 77 days.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
When the captains of these clippers, dressed in "lustrous,
straw-colored, raw-silk suits," paraded the water front
of New York, they were more admired and envied by
the loungers than any prince or potentate on earth. They
were the kings of the sea by right of conquest. Imagine
what Captain Waterman would have done if told that
he reigned by grace of "a system of national protection
deliberately initiated in 1789!"
</p>
<p>In 1849 the British government, in a desperate determination
to place British shipping ahead of American
in quality as well as quantity, repealed the old navigation
laws. British merchants were not only permitted to buy
American ships, but American ships were permitted to
enter all trades to the United Kingdom. The British
ship-builders declared their business would be ruined;
and the building of the old-style wooden ships was ruined.
The ship-owners, too, saw disaster staring them in the
face, and, for a time, there was reason for their fears. For
where the British ships in the tea trade received from
£3 to £4 per ton (50 cubic feet) from Canton to London,
the American clippers received six and even more.
</p>
<p>The little Baltimore clipper <i>Architect</i>, having made a
run from Canton to London in 107 days, beating the fleet
by about a week, she was paid £8 a ton when next she
applied for a cargo of new-crop teas. The ordinary ships
were glad to get the common £4.
</p>
<p>In the meantime the California territory was acquired
from Mexico by the treaty proclaimed July 4, 1848.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
Placer gold had already been discovered in El Dorado
county (January 24), and when official reports confirmed
the wide-spread rumors of the "find," a migration of gold-seekers
such as the world had never seen was begun.
</p>
<p>The growth of population in the territory was phenomenal,
and the growth at once created an insistent demand for
many products of civilization, especially for such things
as were needed by miners and town-builders; for the whole
region was a wilderness. This demand was backed by
gold washed from the placers, and the prices seem now
almost beyond belief.
</p>
<p>"On the 1st of July, 1849, lumber was selling at San
Francisco for $500 per 1000 feet. A better quality of
lumber could be purchased in New York for $12&mdash;in
Maine for $10." (Ex. Doc. 2, 32 Cong. 1 sess. p. 306.)
At the same time, (Phil. Quar. Reg., Dec. 1849), eggs were
selling as high as $2 a dozen, hens for $4 each, butter at
$1.50 a pound, and potatoes, by the pound, 6 to 8 cents;
turnips and cabbages still higher.
</p>
<p>The merchants made haste to forward the needed supplies;
thousands of eager gold-hunters sought passage on
the outbound ships, and the one demand of the merchant
and the passenger was for speed.
</p>
<p>The number of ships obtainable being inadequate, the
merchants went to the shipyards, and it was then that the
most famous of all the American clippers were built.
</p>
<p>The records of some of the old ships that were at once
put into the California trade were not bad. The <i>Colonel</i>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
<i>Fremont</i> reached San Francisco after a passage of 127
days, and the <i>Grey Eagle</i> in 117. But the <i>Flying Cloud</i>,
built by Donald McKay of Boston, and sailed by Captain
Josiah P. Creesy, of Marblehead, in 1851, made the passage
in 89 days, and in one day covered 374 sea miles. The
length of this passage is given as 84 days in some accounts,
but <i>A Description of the New Clipper Great
Republic</i>, a pamphlet printed at Eastburn's Press, Boston,
in 1853, for Donald McKay, says the time was 89 days.
This pamphlet also says that the outlook for profits led
McKay to build the <i>Sovereign of the Seas</i>, a ship of 2400
tons, and then the largest, longest, and sharpest merchant
ship in the world. "Contrary to the advice of his best
friends, he built her on his own account; he embarked all
he was worth in her, for no merchant in this vicinity would
risk capital in such a vessel, as she was considered too large
and costly for any trade.... To the surprise of even
those who knew him best, he played the merchant and
loaded her himself. And well he was rewarded. He
not only sold her on his own terms, but her performances
exceeded his expectations."
</p>
<p>Captain Lachlan McKay, brother of Donald, commanded
this famous clipper. In August, 1851, she left
New York for San Francisco, and until well beyond the
Horn made record speed; but off Valparaiso, while the
captain was driving her through a gale by night, an extra
heavy squall carried away her fore and main topmasts.
Captain McKay was sitting in an arm-chair on the quarter-deck

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
at the time, and that chair was his only bed for the
next two weeks. During that time new masts were made
and got on end, the yards were crossed and sail was made.
She reached San Francisco in 102 days from New York
in spite of the disaster.
</p>
<p>Going to Honolulu, the <i>Sovereign of the Seas</i> loaded whale-oil
for New York. In the course of the passage she sailed
3144 sea miles in 10 consecutive days, and arrived in New
York in 82 days. There she loaded for Liverpool, sailed
on June 18, 1852, and anchored in the Mersey 13 days
and 19 hours later. During this passage she covered
340 sea miles in a day. Her next voyage was to San
Francisco, and during the return passage, "in 24 consecutive
hours she ran 430 geographical miles." (Eastburn
pamphlet.)
</p>
<p>The <i>Antelope</i> and the <i>Surprise</i> are credited with making
passages from San Francisco to New York in 97 days;
the <i>John Gilpin</i> and the <i>Sweepstakes</i> in 94; the <i>Flying Fish</i>
and the <i>Great Republic</i> in 92, and the <i>Sword Fish</i> in 91.
Professor J. Russell Smith's <i>Ocean Carrier</i> says the <i>Comet</i>
made the passage in 76 days. Her record is disputed (see
<i>Shipping Illustrated</i>, New York, April 3, 1909), but the
<i>Nautical Magazine</i>, April, 1856, confirms it. It is not
disputed that the <i>Northern Light</i> ran from San Francisco
to Boston in 76 days, and Captain A. H. Clark, in <i>Harper's
Magazine</i>, June, 1908, says the <i>Trade Wind</i> made the
San Francisco-New York passage in the same number
of days.

</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
The <i>Great Republic</i>, built by Donald McKay, was the
largest American clipper ship. She was "325 feet long,
53 feet wide and her whole depth is 39 feet." She was "of
4000 tons register and full 6000 tons stowage capacity."
She had four masts, the after, or spanker, mast carrying
fore and aft sails only. Her main-yard was 120 feet long.
After she was loaded at New York for her maiden voyage
she was accidentally burned, the total loss, as insured,
amounting to $400,000. The sunken hull was raised,
rebuilt at a cost of $27,000 and she was then rigged
as before. In rebuilding her, a less depth of hull
was given, but she was still able to carry 4000 tons dead
weight. With 3000 tons in her hold she ran from New
York to the coast of England in 12 days. In the Guano
trade from the west coast of South America she was credited
with making 412 miles in one day. (Admiral Preble in
<i>U. S. Serv. Mag.</i>, July, 1889.) The <i>Red Jacket</i> once covered
413 sea miles in a day, and the <i>Flying Scud</i> claimed
a day's run of 449, but this was disputed. (See <i>Nautical
Magazine</i>, June, 1855.) The undisputed record day's run
was made by the <i>Lightning</i>, built by Donald McKay, for
English capitalists. A letter from McKay which appeared
in the <i>Scientific American</i> on November 26, 1859, says:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"Although I designed and built the clipper ship <i>Lightning</i>,
and therefore ought to be the last to praise her, yet such has
been her performance <i>since Englishmen learned to sail her</i>,
that I must confess I feel proud of her. You are aware
that she was so sharp and concave forward that one of her

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
stupid captains, who did not comprehend the principle
upon which she was built, persuaded the owners to fill in
the hollows of her bows. They did so, and according to
their Bullish bluff notions, she was not only better for the
addition, but would sail faster, and wrote me to that effect.
Well, the next passage to Melbourne, Australia, she washed
the encumbrance away on one side, and when she returned
to Liverpool, the other side was also cleared away. Since
then she has been running as I modelled her. As a specimen
of her speed I may say that I saw recorded in her log
(of 24 hours) 436 nautical miles, a trifle over 18 knots an
hour."
</p>
<p>A few records will give an idea of the profits of the best
of the clippers. The <i>Sovereign of the Seas</i> received $84,000
freight money for the passage when she was dismasted,
and her owner says she earned $200,000 in the first eleven
months. The <i>Surprise</i>, Captain Dumaresque, in a voyage
from New York to San Francisco and then by way of China
home, made a net profit of $50,000 above her cost and all
expenses. The <i>Great Republic</i>, according to Preble, received
$160,000 freight in a passage from New York to
San Francisco. It seems worth noting here that the insurance
rates on these hard-driven clippers were far lower
than can now be obtained by the best of modern sailing
ships.
</p>
<p>The most interesting period in the history of the American
merchant marine is the clipper ship era. The story
has been told over and again, but the interest never flags.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
And yet while those ships were sweeping the seas and lying
in port where their captains walked the piers in suits of
lustrous China silks; and while the newspapers of Europe
as well as America were printing in leaded lines the details
of their wonderful passages, <i>the seafaring people of the
United States were living in a fool's paradise</i>. The work
that was to drive the American flag from the principal
trade routes of the seas had been begun before the keel of
the clipper <i>Rainbow</i> was stretched. Our seafaring people
saw it, too, and even helped it on, but with but one notable
exception, so far as the record shows, they utterly failed to
comprehend its significance.
</p>
<p>The character and effect of that work shall be described
in another chapter. It remains to consider here one
other interesting fact about the clippers. It is demonstrable
that the shapes of the much-lauded clipper hulls
had only a trifling, if any, influence upon the speed attained.
Indeed the lines upon which the builders of the
most famous of them all relied for speed were inferior, as
modern designers know, to those of some ordinary ships
wholly unknown to the record.
</p>
<p>As a first bit of evidence in proof of this assertion here is
the story of the <i>Natchez</i> in which Captain "Bob" Waterman
first won fame. In 1843 Waterman sailed her around
the world and made the passage from Canton to New York
in 94 days. The whole voyage required only 9 months
and 26 days. In 1844 he drove her from New York to
Valparaiso in 71 days, thence to Callao in 8, and thence to

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Hongkong in 54. She then loaded teas at Canton and he
drove her from that port to New York, 13,955 miles, in
78 days. This last passage was but one day longer than
Waterman's record passage of 77 days made in the <i>Sea
Witch</i>, "the swiftest clipper of her day." But the <i>Natchez</i>
was not a clipper, although she has been described as one.
She was built with full lines and a flat bottom in order that
she might carry huge loads of cotton from New Orleans,
across the shoals at the mouths of the Mississippi, and
around to New York; and while engaged in that trade, she
had earned the reputation of being one of the slowest ships
on the American coast!
</p>
<p>As to the lines of the clippers note that while Donald
McKay supposed that the <i>Lightning</i> made her great speed
because she was "hollow" at the bow, the modern yacht
designers, who have tried out the hollow lines for years,
have entirely abandoned them. The famous <i>America</i>
had hollow lines; no modern yacht has anything of the
kind.
</p>
<p>The <i>Dreadnought</i>, with her unequalled North Atlantic
record, was called a "semi-clipper," in her day. Her lines,
as printed in Griffiths's <i>Nautical Magazine</i>, show that she
was as full as many ships that were never classed as anything
but plain cargo carriers. In connection with this
fact recall the records of a ship or two built long before
the clipper era&mdash;Derby's <i>Mount Vernon</i>, for instance,
with her passage of 17 days from Salem to Gibraltar.
The <i>Silas Richards</i>, formerly a packet between New

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
York and Liverpool, left New York in June, 1836, for
Canton, and she was back in New York at the end of March,
1837. Her run home was made in 91 days. Even the old
<i>Desire</i> (high in poop and low in spars, when compared
with the clippers) made the passage, away back in 1640,
from Boston to Gravesend in 23 days.
</p>
<p>Out of 157 vessels that arrived at San Francisco in 1852,
no less than seventy had been designed as clippers, of
which, however, only three or four made notable passages.
</p>
<p>No complete list of the ships built with clipper lines was
ever made, nor can one be made now; but out of the 2656
ships and barks launched between 1843 and 1855, which
was the clipper era, it is certain that at least 10 per cent&mdash;256&mdash;were
of the clipper model. But only a few more
than a score ever made better records than the previously
built packets had made. Indeed, many of the leanest and
sharpest of the clipper hulls, together with (curiously
enough) others that were built from the drawings of some
of the successful clippers, were absolute failures, so far as
speed was concerned.
</p>
<p>This is not to deny that the clippers were in some respects
grand ships. They were superior in the strength of hull,
<i>in the breadth of beam</i>, and, consequently, <i>in the spread of
canvas under which they could stand</i>. In the <i>general proportions</i>
of their hulls many of them were right&mdash;as was the
old frigate <i>Constitution</i>, which had a bow as round as an
apple and yet had a record of better than 12 knots an
hour. But even when all of that is said, the fact remains

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
that the full-lined <i>Natchez</i> was but a day behind the record
from Canton.
</p>
<p>If it was not to the model of the ships, to what, then,
were the splendid records due? The answer is of the
utmost importance in any study of the American merchant
marine. The records were due to the fact that our seamen
were the most ambitious and the most efficient sailors <i>of
the sail</i> that the world has ever seen. While the gale permitted
the ship to hold her course, the captain paced the
deck the whole night long and caught his sleep by day in
short naps under the weather rail in order that he might see
that she was kept going. The sheets and halyards of
the important sails on those record ships were made of
chains, and they were locked fast in place&mdash;held by padlocks,
so that frightened sailors, unseen by the master,
could not let them fly when the ship, rolling to the
blast at night, dragged her lee rail through the solid
water. When the captain gave an order, the crew
ran with all their might to do the work&mdash;or they were
knocked across the deck with a pump-brake in the hands
of the nerve-racked mate. Captain Waterman even shot
men off the yards because they seemed to be handling
the sails slowly. Studding sails were spread to the zephyrs
when the ship crossed the equator, and they were yet
seen in place while she sailed with trade-winds so strong
that ships from Europe close-hauled were reefed down
to the cap. Indeed, all sail was often carried when
ordinary ships were seen reefed down on the same

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
course. As Clark Russell notes in one of his novels,
the skipper of the ship from Europe, as he paced the
deck with anxious eyes upon his shortened canvas, fearing
that it would be blown from the bolt ropes, very
often saw a tiny white speck upon the horizon, watched it
grow into a splendid ship with "every rag set," saw her
fling the Stars and Stripes to the gale, as she went roaring
by, and then with feelings that cannot be described, gazed
after her until she disappeared in the mists far down
the lee.
</p>
<p>If the two crews thus meeting in mid-ocean could
have changed ships, the bluff-bowed hulk from Europe
would soon have gone smoking away while the clipper
would have rolled her spars over the lee rail before her
new crew could have learned the lead of a single sheet or
halyard.
</p>
<p>It was the man on the quarter-deck&mdash;he who had handled
ships among the rocks of the South Shetlands, or had
lanced whales in the North Pacific, or had skimmed the
sands of Cape Hatteras, in order to learn the arts of the
sea as handed down from the beginning&mdash;it was the master
mariner evolved by two hundred years of battle&mdash;with
the sea and its people&mdash;who made the American flag supreme
upon all the seas of the whole world.

<h2>CHAPTER XIII
<br />
<span class="s08">DEEP-WATER STEAMSHIPS&mdash;PART I</span>
</h2>
<p><span class="b20">I</span>N order to comprehend the story of the efforts to
establish lines of steam packets under the American
flag between the United States and various ports in
Europe, it is necessary at this point to review briefly our
foreign relations in the period between the War of 1812
and the Civil War, and then to consider what was done by
the British in the early development of steam navigation.
</p>
<p>In the year 1818, in the course of what is known as the
Seminole War, General Jackson, at the head of a strong
body of troops, invaded the Spanish territory of Florida,
captured a number of fortified places, and ruthlessly
hanged one British subject named Arbuthnot and shot
another named Ambrister on the unproved charge that the
two had been "stirring up the Indians to war with the
United States." No war followed this outrage, but the ill
feeling which had animated the British after the War of
1812 was greatly intensified.
</p>
<p>Trouble over the northeast boundary of the United States
followed, and when the king of the Netherlands was asked
to arbitrate the matter, he laid down a line which was not

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
satisfactory to the English. At the same time it was exasperating
to the Americans, especially to the people of
Maine. In fact, open hostilities in a small way occurred
near the boundary.
</p>
<p>In 1837 the British manner of ruling the Canadian region
created so much opposition among the settlers there that a
small insurrection broke out. It was suppressed, but only
to break out again, and at this time a number of American
sympathizers joined the insurgents. A band of the insurgents
having taken possession of Navy Island, in the
Niagara River, the American sympathizers went in the
American steamer <i>Caroline</i> to join them, and carried arms
and supplies. The steamer then returned to American
waters, but the British loyalists crossed over the line, captured
the steamer, set her on fire, and sent her over Niagara
Falls. One American was killed in the attack. Later a
Canadian deputy sheriff boasted that he had killed the man
whose life was taken, and then, in 1840, incautiously came
across to Lockport, New York, where he was arrested for the
murder. His name was Alexander McLeod. Thereupon
the British government, with the aggressive Palmerston in
the lead, avowed that the <i>Caroline</i> was seized on the authority
of the nation, and peremptorily demanded McLeod's
release. The Washington authorities were disposed to
yield, but Governor Seward, of New York, declared that
McLeod should stand trial; and he did. But having
proved an alibi, he was acquitted, and on October 12, 1841,
he was returned to Canada. In the meantime an American

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
had been seized as a hostage to abide McLeod's fate.
He was of course released at last.
</p>
<p>In the course of the year 1841 an American coaster
named the <i>Creole</i>, while carrying a cargo of slaves from the
breeding grounds in Virginia to the ever eager market in
the Southwest, was taken from her officers and crew by the
slaves, who then ran the vessels to the Bahamas, where the
slaves, 125 in number, were protected. The slave owners
of the United States had been restive because of frequent
reports that British cruisers, engaged in suppressing the
slave trade upon the coast of Africa, had "exercised the
right of search" by boarding ships under the American flag,
and when the story of the protection of the <i>Creole's</i> cargo
reached the country, the excitement rose toward the war
heat.
</p>
<p>In the meantime, the United States had annexed Florida.
Then the Texans set up an independent government, and
it was recognized as an independent nation, but with its
people openly anxious for annexation to the United States.
The statesmen of England saw that annexation was inevitable
and that a war with Mexico would follow, with the result
that the territory of the United States would be enlarged
in the Southwest and along the Spanish Main, where
British subjects were looking for a further extension of territory
and influence. For at about this time the ancient
settlement of logwood cutters at Belize was developed into
the colony of British Honduras (1845). Although England
had subscribed to and helped to enforce the Monroe

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
Doctrine, her statesmen were looking to an extension of
British Honduras as far south as the mouth of the Rio San
Juan, in Nicaragua. To secure this extension a protectorate
over the Mosquito Coast Indians was declared, and
the coast was assumed to be territory entirely independent
of Nicaragua. On August 19, 1841, British war-ships captured
San Juan del Norte, at the mouth of the San Juan,
drove away the Nicaragua officials, and installed Mosquito
Indians. The Nicaraguans soon drove away the
Mosquito forces, but the interest in the place having been
intensified by projects for building an interoceanic canal
across the country, the British returned, late in 1847, and
on January 10, 1848, placed the Mosquito chiefs once more
in possession.
</p>
<p>With the rush of emigrants to California, the United
States became interested in this aggression. It would
never do to allow the British to control such a highway
as was then in contemplation. The British naturally
held on to what they had secured at the mouth of the San
Juan, however, and then, with a view of obtaining control
of the other end of the canal route (the Gulf of Fonseca),
they began to press Honduras for the payment of certain
claims of British subjects, the nature of which is of no
importance because the claims were merely a pretext for
an aggression that would have been made had no claims
been in existence. To back these claims a British warship
appeared, but when the Honduranians were in straits,
the American envoy to Nicaragua heard of their trouble,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
hastened to meet them, and then negotiated a treaty
(September 28, 1849) by which a part of Tigre Island and
a part of the coast of the Gulf of Fonseca were granted to
the United States for a naval station. When the British
envoy learned how he had been outwitted, he ordered some
of the naval force at his command to seize Tigre Island in
contempt of the acquired rights of the United States.
(See Keasbey's <i>Nicaragua Canal</i> and Pims <i>Panama</i>.)
That the British fully expected a war with the United
States, is beyond dispute. In fact, they had been prepared
for war ever since 1840, but the Nicaragua matter it was
supposed would surely bring on the long-looked-for contest.
</p>
<p>To add to the dangers of the situation, a dispute had
arisen, meantime, over the northwestern boundary of
the United States, a controversy commonly referred to in
history as the Oregon Question. The United States
claimed the territory as far north as the south line of Alaska,
then belonging to Russia, in latitude 54° 40'. The
British claimed as far south as the Columbia River. The
claims created great excitement in this country in 1845, and
the cry of "Fifty-four forty, or fight" was heard throughout
the nation.
</p>
<p>To show the state of feeling in England at that time,
here is a quotation from a letter written by Louis McLean,
American Minister to London, to the Secretary of State,
January 3, 1846.
</p>
<p>"I sought an interview with Lord Aberdeen, in order
that, in conformity with your instructions, I might bring

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
to his notice the warlike preparations making by Great
Britain, and, if possible, ascertain their real character and
object.... In introducing the subject I adverted at
the same time to the information the President had received
from various sources, of the extensive preparations making
by Great Britain, and the natural inference upon his part
that, in the present pacific state of the relations of Great
Britain with all the powers of Europe, they could only look
to a rupture with the United States.... Lord Aberdeen
said very promptly and frankly that it would be improper
to disguise that, with the sincerest wish to avoid it, they
were obliged to look to the possibility of a rupture with
the United States, and that in such a crisis the warlike
preparations now making would be useful and important....
He stated that the most extensive and formidable
parts of their preparations were the fortifications of the
principal and exposed stations ... and to <i>the increase
of the number of steam vessels</i> in lieu of the old craft."
(See Cong. <i>Globe</i>, February 6, 1847.)
</p>
<p>In short, during the whole period under consideration,
the Americans and the British were constantly animated
by intense antipathy and even animosity, each toward
the other.
</p>
<p>While turning, now, to the story of the evolution of
British steamships, it will be worth while to recall first what
has already been said about the environment that developed
the character of the American sailor. From the day when
the men of Massachusetts Bay built ships and launched

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
forth in them to catch fish and trade with foreign countries,
until such men as Palmer, Samuels, and Waterman made
marvellous speed with whatever form of ship they happened
to command, the whole environment of the American
seafaring population had served to develop excellence in
handling ships of the sail.
</p>
<p>With this fact in mind, note that steamers made an extraordinary
change in the conditions of transportation
by ships. These conditions were so far removed from the
old that a portrait-painter who had never learned any of
the arts of the sea designed the first commercially successful
steamer in the United States. The keeper of a bathhouse
performed a similar service for the British public.
When steam navigation had become an assured success,
the splendid skill of the sailor <i>of the sail</i> was no longer
needed. The man at the throttle usurped the place of
the man on the weather yard-arm, and this is true in spite
of the curious and absurd fact that even now the captains
of steamships do not reach the bridge by way of the stokehole.
</p>
<p>Then recall the fact that while the United States had
produced excellent sailors of the sail, there was such a
dearth of mechanics in Fulton's day that he was obliged
to import the <i>Clermont's</i> engine from England; and Stevens,
though he built his own engines, was obliged to train men
to work in iron before he could do so. The British had
been building efficient engines for twenty years before
Fulton bought his. In every application of steam power,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
the British were that much in advance of the Americans.
</p>
<p>As Day points out in his <i>History of Commerce</i>, inventors
living in the United States, as well as in other countries,
went to England to perfect their inventions, because of
the superior facilities afforded in British machine shops;
and this was done as late as 1836&mdash;even later. Some of
the best machinery invented in the United States, in the
period under consideration, was first put in use in Great
Britain.
</p>
<p>The fact that abundant supplies of coal were to be had
at low price in Great Britain is not to be overlooked in
connection with this argument. With the consequent
great progress in factory industries, the time was close at
hand when all England was to become "a free port"
for all the world, as well as a place for working up the raw
materials of all other countries.
</p>
<p>Still another important fact is this, that the American
capitalists who began to invest in steamships at an early
day, found immense stretches of inland waters upon which
to develop the carrying trade, while the inland waters of
Great Britain were of insignificant extent, and the capitalists
there were soon engaged in the coasting trade where the
waters were by no means pacific. In 1818 the <i>Rob Roy</i>
was put on the route between Glasgow and Belfast, and
a little later she was sent to ply between Dover and Calais.
In 1822 a line was established between Liverpool and Glasgow,
and this was followed in 1826 by a line plying between

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
Edinburgh and London. These last ships were 160 feet
long and were provided with engines of 200 horse-power;
they were regarded as such marvellous ships that people
came from all parts of the kingdom to look at them. And
it is to be noted that all the coasters so far mentioned were
provided with a form of engine (the side lever) which was
efficient for deep-water service.
</p>
<p>Following the success of the Glasgow line, other lines
were established to various ports of Europe, including
one to Bordeaux, the ships of which had to cross the
stormy Bay of Biscay and traverse a route 1600 miles long.
All of this is to emphasize the fact that while the steamship
men of the United States were making records upon the
Hudson and other <i>inland</i> waters, those of Great Britain
were engaged almost exclusively upon waters with a rending
power little, if any, less than that of the Atlantic. The
environments of the men engaged in steamboat traffic
in the two countries were so different that widely different
classes of ships, engines, <i>and engineers</i> were developed.
The British had been navigating the Bay of Biscay with
success for several years before the Americans put the
<i>Home</i> upon the route around Cape Hatteras.
</p>
<p>And yet it was an American that first stirred up the
British to embark in the transatlantic steamer trade&mdash;Dr.
Junius Smith, who graduated from Yale in 1802, and
then went to London as representative of some American
merchants. The success of the British coasters led Smith
to believe that transatlantic steamers would prove successful,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
and in 1832 he came to the United States to look into
the matter more fully.
</p>
<p>"My friends in New York make no doubt of the practicability
nor of the success of such an undertaking," he wrote
to a director of the London and Edinburgh Steam Packet
Company, "and have assured me that they will build
two steam vessels suited to the object in view," provided
English capitalists would build two more for use in the same
line. Mr. Smith's letter was written to invite the directors
of the company to join in the enterprise, and to charter
to him one of their steamers for a demonstration trip, to
New York. The directors replied with a cold refusal.
Smith, however, tried elsewhere, and when his plans were
presented in the newspapers, the professional humorists
gave much attention to the "Yankee" innovator. In
1836 a noted scientist of the period, Dr. Lardner, in a
lecture at Liverpool, declared that any effort to make
direct passages from New York to Liverpool would prove
"perfectly chimerical, and they might as well talk of making
the direct voyage from New York or Liverpool to the
moon."
</p>
<p>When this lecture was reported in the papers, a number
of steamship men showed by arguments drawn from the
experience of the coasters that Lardner was wrong, but
even with their assistance Smith made two vain efforts
to organize a company. But in July, 1836, when the books
were again opened, enough shares were taken to enable
the company to build a good ship which in time proved

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
successful. But because there were long delays in getting
this vessel afloat, Smith's company chartered the steamer
<i>Sirius</i>, a packet plying between London and Cork, for
a voyage to New York.
</p>
<p>The <i>Sirius</i> was of about the size of a large sailing
packet of the day. She measured 700 tons and had
engines of 320 horse-power. On April 4, 1838, she left
Cork for New York.
</p>
<p>In the meantime, I. K. Brunel, who was then chief
engineer of the Great Western Railroad, had become convinced
of the feasibility of transatlantic steam navigation,
and with a few associates he had built at Bristol a ship
named the <i>Great Western</i>, especially for traffic between
Bristol (the end of the Great Western Railroad) and
New York. This ship was 212 feet long by 35 wide and
23 deep. She registered at 1340 tons. She was provided
with side-lever engines of 440 horse-power, the cylinders
being 73½ inches in diameter by 7 feet stroke.
</p>
<p>As it happened, the <i>Great Western</i> left Bristol for New
York on April 7, and transatlantic steam navigation was
thereby begun with a race. The <i>Sirius</i> arrived first, anchoring
off the Battery, New York, early in the morning
on April 23. The excitement in the city was extraordinary,
and the water about the ship was soon covered with small
boats carrying people for a look at her. And then at
about 11 o'clock, when the throngs around the <i>Sirius</i> were
densest, a lookout announced another steamship in sight
down below, when the crowd began to shout:&mdash;
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
"The <i>Great Western</i>! The <i>Great Western</i>!"
</p>
<p>It was she, and in the middle of the afternoon she anchored
off Pike Street.
</p>
<p>The British consul, in a letter congratulating Lieutenant
R. Roberts, R. N., commanding the <i>Sirius</i>, on arriving first,
said:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"I have a further cause of rejoicing, that the honor of
accomplishing the enterprise has been achieved by a son
of the British navy, and that it was completed on St.
George's Day."
</p>
<p>It was five years after this arrival that the keel of the
first American clipper was laid, but <i>with the termination
of the passages of these two ships</i> the dawn of the day of
British supremacy upon the high seas appeared.
</p>
<p>Special attention seems due to the <i>Great Western</i>, because
she was the first ship built for the traffic. She
had steamed 3125 sea miles, making an average of 208
miles per day, or 8.2 knots an hour. The total consumption
of fuel was 655 tons, less than a day's consumption
in some modern ships. She returned home with a
consumption of only 392 tons, prevailing winds and a large
spread of canvas helping her to save coal. The cost of
this ship was £50,000, of which £13,500 was paid for the
engines. She continued to ply regularly on the route, and
on September 25, 1838, the New York <i>American</i> had this
to say:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"The arrival of the steam packet <i>Great Western</i> puts
us in possession of intelligence to the 8th.... The

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
great success of this enterprise has confirmed the timid and
almost crazed the sanguine. She brings <i>one hundred and
forty passengers</i>. All her berths were engaged before she
arrived at Bristol." Then an article from the London
<i>Times</i> is quoted as follows:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"Upon the eighty-seven passengers home, and the 130
out, at 40 guineas passage money per head in the saloon,
and 35 guineas in the cabin, each way, the directors of the
Great Western will have received upwards of £8000,
exclusive of the benefit derived from the conveyance of
goods, of which the <i>Great Western</i> brought from New York
to the extent of about 200 tons' measurement."
</p>
<p>The Liverpool <i>Albion</i> is then quoted as saying that "the
last trip of the <i>Great Western</i> netted £6000."
</p>
<p>The <i>Great Western</i> continued in the New York and
Bristol and the New York and Liverpool trades until she
had made seventy-four passages, and she was then sold
for use between England and the West Indies. These
facts are of importance to the history of the American
merchant marine, because our writers who have favored
paying subsidies to American steam lines have asserted
that in those days it was not possible to run steamship
lines between the United States and England without a
subsidy. The <i>Great Western</i> made money without a
subsidy. So did many other steamers that followed,
as shall appear.
</p>
<p>We now come, however, to the story of the first lines of
subsidized transatlantic steamships. One Samuel Cunard,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
a wealthy merchant of Nova Scotia, had been dreaming
about steam navigation since 1830, and when the Great
Western Company had shown the way, he went to England
in order to arrange for a line from Liverpool to Halifax,
and thence to Boston. After consultation with eminent
men of experience in steam navigation, he gave an order
to Robert Napier, the foremost designer and builder of
steamships in the kingdom, for four steamships of about
900 tons each. But before the work was begun, Napier
convinced him that larger ships would prove more profitable,
and as the larger ships would cost more than Cunard
had to invest, George Burns, of Glasgow, and David
McIver, of Liverpool (both of whom were men of experience),
were united with him in forming what is now
known as the Cunard Company. The <i>Britannia</i>, the
first ship built for this company, was a wooden vessel
207 feet long by 34 wide and 22 deep, registering 1156
tons. She had engines of 423 horse-power. The other
three ships built at that time were slightly smaller.
</p>
<p>It is to be noted that this company was formed to run
ships in opposition to the <i>Great Western</i> and to Smith's
lines. They were to depend upon what traffic they could
get for success and upon nothing else. But in the meantime
the British government had been considering the
advisability of employing steamships to carry the royal
mail across the Atlantic. Theretofore certain brigs had
been employed by the Admiralty for this purpose, and
beginning in 1821, government-owned brigs were employed

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
exclusively. This proving expensive, the plan of
hiring privately owned brigs was resumed in 1833, and
these brigs were in use at that time. The success of the
<i>Great Western</i> having proven the efficiency of steamships
in the transatlantic trade, the postal authorities, in connection
with the Admiralty, decided to use steam, and
when Cunard came into the field, bids were invited for
a mail service under certain burdensome conditions among
which were these: The ships were to be fit for war use,
carrying heavy guns, a naval officer was to be carried to
care for the mail, and the ships were to be sold to the
Admiralty on demand at a valuation. The Great Western,
as well as the Cunard people, put in bids. The Great
Western did not know that they would have opposition,
and bid accordingly, with the result that Cunard made
the better offer and got the contract. The full story is
told in Lindsay's <i>History of Merchant Shipping</i>. Cunard
was to receive at first £3295 per voyage, but, the plans
having been modified, the subsidy was raised to £81,000
a year. For this he was to maintain a fortnightly service
from Liverpool by way of Halifax to Boston, and with
a line of smaller steamers from Halifax to Quebec. The
<i>Britannia</i> left Liverpool upon her first voyage on July 4,
1840. No American writer has as yet pointed out that
this was "a beautiful coincidence of nominal dates."

</p>
<p class="caption">From a contemporary engraving
</p>
</div>
<p>A few months later the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company
was organized especially to carry the mail to the West
Indies, including St. Thomas, Haiti, and Cuba, and to

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
Chagres, to Mexico, and to the south part of the United
States, as well. A branch line was to be maintained from
the West Indies to Brazil. The contract (made in March,
1841) called for fourteen steamships built so as to carry
"guns of the largest caliber" then in use in the navy;
and the frames and planking were of a thickness to resist
shot as well as a frigate&mdash;as, indeed, were those of the
Cunard line. The commanders of the ships were to be
naval officers. The subsidy paid was £240,000 a year.
</p>
<p>It is important to note that this line was to run regularly
to Chagres, where there was not enough traffic to pay
the expense of the ship while lowering a boat to carry
the mail ashore, and, further, that there was not enough
traffic anywhere on the route to pay any considerable
part of the expense of the line. Indeed, the traffic and
subsidy together proved insufficient to pay expenses.
Further than that, the time allowed in all the ports was
limited&mdash;to six hours at the important island of Barbados,
for instance, and to twenty-four at Port Royal,
Jamaica, where there was an important naval station. It
was impossible to handle any valuable quantity of West
India cargo in such short periods. It is therefore certain that
frequent and swift voyages were wanted in the establishing
of this line, rather than the carrying of cargo. And
this is to say that it was established for the same reasons
that brigs had been used in carrying the royal mail theretofore.
It was a political and military service that the ships
were to perform.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
Consider all these facts in connection with the political
complications with the United States that have been
mentioned. It was in 1840 that the British government
demanded the release of McLeod on pain of war. It
was at that time that the people of Maine and New Brunswick
took up arms in connection with the boundary
dispute. At the same time the British government was
looking ahead to an increase of territory along the Spanish
Main, including a canal across Nicaragua in contempt
of the Monroe Doctrine.
</p>
<p>Then recall the fact that the use of steam for driving
war-ships was yet in the experimental stage. Many able
naval men believed that sails were yet to be preferred, but
the English were especially anxious to learn all about the
new power in order to keep abreast with the progress of
the age&mdash;to preserve their <i>naval</i> superiority. It is of
significance that young naval officers were detailed to
command all of the West India ships and to accompany
those of the Cunard line. Further than that, it is to be
noted that the Admiralty insisted that the subsidized ships
be built of wood not only then, but for years after iron had
proved cheaper and more efficient for merchant ships,
and this was done because it was fully believed that
a wooden ship was best for naval uses.
</p>
<p>In short, the subsidizing of ships was begun chiefly as
a military and diplomatic measure. Any candid review
of the facts shows it. It was done, too, with a full knowledge
that paying a subsidy was against the interests of

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
the other owners of steamships that were already plying
between Liverpool and New York. In fact, the Cunard
line had hardly learned the way to Boston when the Great
Western line made such loud complaints about the destruction
of private enterprise through the subsidizing
of the Cunard that a committee of Parliament took up
the whole matter and concluded that the other steamers
would not be put out of the trade.
</p>
<p>There were men on both sides of the Atlantic who saw
at that time that steam would eventually drive sails from
the packet routes. E. K. Collins was one of these men.
But no one supposed at that time that subsidizing a single
mail line from Liverpool to Boston would do it. And
even the optimistic Cunard directors made no effort to
interfere with the traffic of the New York and Liverpool
sailing packets until it was seen that American capitalists
were about to put on a line of steamers between New York
and Liverpool.
</p>
<p>With these facts in mind, we may now comprehend the
full story of the first American steam-packet lines that ran
across the Atlantic Ocean.

<h2>CHAPTER XIV
<br />
<span class="s08">DEEP-WATER STEAMSHIPS&mdash;PART II</span>
</h2>
<p><span class="b20">T</span>HE success of the British steamers that crossed the
Atlantic in 1838 led a number of New York capitalists
to form what they called the American Atlantic
Steam Navigation Company, of which James de Peyster
Ogden was chairman, and on March 22, 1839, calls for
subscriptions to the capital stock were published in the
New York papers. The answers to the calls were few,
and the enterprise was abandoned.
</p>
<p>Out of several reasons for this failure, consider these:
The American people had but little capital, and there were
calls in many directions for every dollar obtainable. The
calls from the railroads were particularly insistent, for
while the first railroad to use steam (the Albany and
Schenectady) was completed in 1833, the steam mileage
in 1840 was 2380. The inland water traffic was most
attractive. In 1839 the enrolled steamers measured
489,879 tons, and they were worn out so rapidly that every
vessel had to be replaced (on the average) within four
years. Then the deep-water sailing ships absorbed much
capital, the tonnage in 1839 being 829,096, while the coasting

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
tonnage measured 1,032,023 tons, and all these vessels
were, on the average, highly profitable.
</p>
<p>Of the other attractive calls for capital, nothing need
be said, but a brief reference to an attempt to form a
company to run transatlantic steamships from Philadelphia
may be quoted from <i>Niles's Register</i> of August
25, 1838:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"At a meeting of the citizens held in the Merchants'
Exchange, Philadelphia, to take such measures to forward
the plan for a communication by steam between that city
and Europe ... the following resolutions were unanimously
adopted: ... Resolved that we have learned
with lively satisfaction the willingness of our brethren
of Great Britain to coöperate with us in this great enterprise"
by making a liberal subscription for the construction
of "such steamships as might be needed."
</p>
<p>The "brethren" were not quite as willing to "coöperate"
as was supposed, but the "great enterprise" was taken in
hand a few years later by a man named William Inman,
with notable results.
</p>
<p>In considering their failures to organize transatlantic
steamship companies, these business men did not fail to
refer to the fact that the British government was paying
subsidies to the Cunard and the Royal Mail steamship
companies. The fact that the Cunard subsidy was a hardship
for the owners of the unsubsidized steamers in the
American trade was not dwelt upon. The people were
told that subsidies were given in order to build up a steam

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
merchant marine. Then Congress was invited to consider
the fact that in subsidizing two lines of steamships Great
Britain had secured eighteen fine ships fit to add to her
growing steam naval fleet. Naval officers were carried
on all those ships, and they were not only learning how to
handle steam, but they <i>were learning to navigate American
waters</i>&mdash;and all this at a period when England and the
United States were on the verge of war.
</p>
<p>Thereupon Thomas Butler King, chairman of the House
Naval Committee, brought forward a plan for a subsidized
mail line under the American flag. (Ho. Reps. 681 and 685,
28 Cong. 1 sess.) His arguments in favor of a subsidy
were: That a reduction might be made in the rate of postage,
and yet the income from the mails would soon pay all
the subsidy that would be required. That our naval
officers would learn how to handle steam. That we should
learn how to build efficient steamships for deep water.
That a line to the north of Europe would promote emigration
and trade. In connection with this last argument
it was stated that the British post-office authorities were in
the habit of holding up all mails bound across England
to the continent until the British merchants had had time
to read and act upon their advices from America, and
the newspapers had had time to print all the American
news. After considering the matter for four years, Congress
acted, on March 3, 1845, in a bill providing&mdash;
</p>
<p>"That the Postmaster-general ... is hereby authorized
... to contract for the transportation of the United

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
States mail between any of the ports of the United States,
and a port or ports of any foreign Power, whenever,
in his opinion, the public interest will thereby be promoted
... for any greater period than four years and
not exceeding ten years. All such contracts shall be made
with citizens of the United States, and the mail to be
transported in American vessels by American citizens."
</p>
<p>Thereupon the Postmaster-general contracted with
Edward Mills of New York, who agreed to build ships to
plans approved by the Secretary of the Navy, and run a
steam-packet line from New York to Southampton and
Bremen, twenty voyages a year, for a subsidy of $400,000.
If alternate voyages were made to Havre instead of Bremen,
the subsidy was to be $350,000.
</p>
<p>Mills and his associates were incorporated (May 8, 1846),
as the Ocean Steam Navigation Company. Contracts
were let for the building of two steamships, and then the
troubles of the company began. On learning that an
American company was to enter the transatlantic trade, the
Cunard Company began running packets regularly to New
York. The opposition of this established line increased
the timidity of capitalists so much that in spite of the guaranteed
income of at least $350,000 a year, it was impossible to
obtain the needed money in the United States, and "money
was furnished for the undertaking by the little government
of Bremen, and by individuals connected with the enterprise
on the other side of the Atlantic, and pretty largely
furnished, too." (App. Cong. <i>Globe</i>, September 4, 1850.)
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
The one deadly misfortune of the company, however,
was found in the fact that the Americans had not yet
learned how to build ocean-going steamships. Said the
<i>Merchants' Magazine</i>, May, 1849, regarding the first ships
of the line:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"The models of the <i>Washington</i> and <i>Hermann</i> were
quite defective, particularly so in having a very narrow
bottom, which made them load deep and be tender or even
crank at all times.... <i>Their engines also were not quite
strong or stiff enough.</i>"
</p>
<p>The boilers were not large enough to furnish an adequate
supply of steam and the paddle-wheels were too large for the
engines. The <i>Scientific American</i>, October 7, 1848, said:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"The great cause of our unsuccess in our Atlantic
steamers is owing to our short acquaintance with the building
of marine ships. There is science and genius among
our nautical engineers, but <i>they want experience</i>."
</p>
<p>When our first American mail steamer sailed for Europe
no practical marine engineers could be found to work her
engines. She took a first-class engineer and corps of assistants
from one of the New York river packets; but as soon as
the ship got to sea, and heavy breakers came on, all the engineers
and firemen were taken deadly seasick; and for
three days it was constantly expected that the ship would
be lost. (Rainey's <i>Ocean Steam Navigation</i>.)
</p>
<p>It is to be noted here that John L. Stevens, the ablest
American marine engineer of his day, was one of the directors
of this company.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
The <i>Washington</i> sailed for Southampton and Bremen
on June 1, 1847. Her passengers and crew looked forward
to a cheering reception on the other side; for when the
<i>Sirius</i> and the <i>Great Western</i> arrived in New York the
people of the city turned out to honor them, and the city
authorities and such bodies as the Chamber of Commerce
gave public receptions in honor of the event. Then when
the Cunard's first liner the <i>Britannia</i> was frozen in at Boston
the merchants of the city contributed $10,000, for which
a contractor agreed to saw a channel for her to clear water.
The contractor spent $20,000 in doing the work. He spent
$10,000 out of his own pocket without a murmur, and the
Cunard Company without a murmur let him do it. But
the only official action taken on the arrival of the <i>Washington</i>
at Southampton was in the sending of a notice to the
American mail agent that he would have to pay full sea
postage on all mail landed, as well as the usual inland rates.
And the only word of welcome spoken in the port was uttered
by the officials of the dock company with whom the
ship was berthed.
</p>
<p>Because of their financial difficulties the company organized
a separate corporation to build and run ships to
Havre. The <i>Humbolt</i> and the <i>Franklin</i> were put on this
route in 1849. The <i>Humbolt</i> was wrecked at Halifax,
December 5, 1853, and the <i>Franklin</i> stranded on Montauk
Point, July 17, 1854. The <i>Arago</i> and <i>Fulton</i>, built to
replace these two, were somewhat better than any ocean-going
steamships theretofore built in the United States,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
and they were able to continue the service until the government
chartered them for use in the Civil War (1861).
The two Bremen ships were laid up after their subsidy
ceased&mdash;1859. All six of these ships used by this corporation
were slow as well as expensive to operate. The
time used in the Bremen passage was about fourteen days;
that to Havre, twelve.
</p>
<p>The Collins Line (New York and Liverpool U. S. Mail
Steamship Company), was the most famous of the subsidized
lines. E. K. Collins was a Truro, Cape Cod, boy,
who, at the age of fifteen (1817), became a clerk to a New
York merchant. Five years later he was sent to sea as a
supercargo, and a little later he became a partner in the
business. His first memorable stroke of business was made
in 1825, when cotton took a sudden rise in the Liverpool
market. The news of the rise reached New York on the day
that the regular Charleston, South Carolina, packet was to
sail, and a number of New York merchants took passage on
the ship, intending to buy all the cotton in Charleston before
the news of the rise could be learned there. As the packet
passed the bar at Sandy Hook, bound out, the merchants
on her deck saw a pilot-boat, with young Collins on her
deck, head away down the coast; and with one accord they
made jeering remarks at the idea of a little schooner trying
to beat the regular packet in such a race. But when they
reached the Charleston bar they met the boat with Collins
on board coming out. He had bought all the cotton.
</p>
<p>With money made in that deal and with some obtained

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
by marrying a rich wife, Collins started the New Orleans
packet line, and another line thence to Tampico. These
having proved successful, he then established the famous
Dramatic Line to Liverpool. In 1840, Collins said:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"There is no longer chance for enterprise with sails. It
is steam that must win the day. I will build steamers that
shall make the passage from New York to Europe in ten
days and less."
</p>
<p>In the winter of 1846-1847 Collins and others persuaded
Congress to pass the act dated March 3, 1847. It provided
for the construction of four naval steamers in place of
ten that the naval committee had asked for; for a contract
between the Secretary of the Navy and Collins &amp; Co.,
for transporting the mail between New York and Liverpool;
for a contract between the Secretary of the Navy and
A. G. Sloo for transporting the mail between New York and
New Orleans with a stop at Havana, and from Havana to
Chagres, on the Isthmus of Panama&mdash;known as the Law
Line, from George Law, the leading capitalist; for a contract
with unnamed capitalists (C. H. Aspinwall was the
leader), for a mail service between Panama and the ports
of San Francisco and Astoria.
</p>
<p>Collins's company had a paid-in capital of $1,200,000.
By his contract, signed in November, 1847, he was to receive
$19,250 per voyage for making two voyages per
month for eight months of the year and one a month during
four winter months. For this service Collins was to
build four steamships measuring "not less than 2000 tons

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
each," and complete them ready for sea within eighteen
months; also a fifth ship "as early as may be practicable
thereafter." Each ship was to carry a naval officer, as
mail agent, and four passed midshipmen to serve as deck
officers.
</p>
<p>Contracts were made for the four ships, and many different
statements have been made regarding their size and
cost. Chief Engineer Isherwood, of the navy, put the size
of the <i>Atlantic</i> and the <i>Pacific</i> at 2686 tons each; the <i>Arctic</i>
and <i>Baltic</i> at 2772. Senator Rusk, of Texas, who vigorously
supported the line in all its appeals to Congress, said
the four measured 11,131 tons in the aggregate. The
<i>Merchant's Magazine</i> (Vol. 22, p. 682) rated them at 3500
tons each and said they cost $650,000 each. G. S. Houston,
in a speech in Congress on July 7, 1852, quoted the
company to prove that the average cost of the ships was
$736,035.67 each.
</p>
<p>With a paid-up capital of $1,200,000, four ships were
built that cost at least twice as much as the money in hand
would pay for, and they were each at least 700 tons larger
than the contract called for. The builders gave Collins
credit, and thereby secured the work on their own terms.
And yet while thus paying the highest prices for his ships,
and with an ever growing debt staring him in the face, Collins
was recklessly extravagant in furnishing his cabins, and
in every department of the company's management.
</p>
<p>As a result, within six months after the contract was
signed with the Secretary of the Navy, Collins was back in

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
the lobby at Washington, "begging and boring" for further
help. By the act of August 3, 1848, the Secretary of
the Navy was authorized to advance $25,000 a month on
each of the four ships until they should be put into commission,
and the time for completing them was extended to
June 1, 1850. Under a subsequent agreement this advance
was paid back in small instalments.
</p>
<p>And during all this time Collins walked the streets, telling
all who would listen that he was going to run the <i>Scotch-built,
Scotch-managed</i> Cunarders off the sea!
</p>
<p>When done, the ships were found to have fine models&mdash;they
rode the waves in a way that excited the admiration
of all sailors. But the keelsons under the engines were only
forty inches deep, while the keels were 277 feet long, and
there was "give" enough to rack the engines to pieces&mdash;a
fact showing conclusively the ignorance of the designer so
far as ocean steamships were concerned. And yet George
Steers, the famous designer of the yacht <i>America</i>, was the
responsible man! As the <i>Scientific American</i> had said of
our engineers, he "wanted experience."
</p>
<p>The <i>Atlantic</i> began the service on April 27, 1850. It was
in this year that the average American sailing ship was
making three voyages where foreign ships made but two.
For thirty years our sailing packets had carried the broom
on the North Atlantic. The captains of the Canton tea
clippers, dressed in raw silk, were strutting about the water
front, boasting of passages that were the wonder of the
world. And here was a new line of steamers with a managing

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
owner who had won fame as the owner of swift ships,
and who had been assuring the whole world that he was
going to beat all creation with steam!
</p>
<p>In the mind of the captain of the <i>Atlantic</i> the honor of
the Stars and Stripes was in his custody, and he could keep
it safe only by driving the ship to the utmost limit of speed.
And each of the other ships was also driven to the last gasp.
In May, 1851, the <i>Pacific</i> ran from New York to Liverpool
in 9 days, 20 hours, and 16 minutes. In August, 1852,
the <i>Baltic</i> crossed from Liverpool to New York in 9 days
and 13 hours. Collins had kept his promise to drive a
ship across the Atlantic in less than ten days.
</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Cunard Company, to meet the determined
opposition, built new ships, and the British government
raised the subsidy to $16,500 per voyage. Orders
were issued in England to drive the new Cunarders, too,
but it was impossible for them to equal the rampant Collins
liners at that time.
</p>
<p>For a time it seemed to the American people that the
supremacy upon the seas was to be maintained with steam,
and not a few Englishmen, including the editor of the
<i>London Times</i>, took a pessimistic view of the situation. A
little later, however, the situation was seen in its true light.
On February 15, 1851, when the <i>Atlantic</i> had been in commission
but ten months, the <i>Scientific American</i> said
editorially that "it is very foolish to push through a steamship
on a long passage by dint of coal." The <i>New York
Herald</i>, a nautical specialist, was complaining, meantime,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
that the American firemen were wretchedly inefficient. It
was admitted by the company, later still, that for the first
twenty-eight voyages of the line the average cost of coal
was $8612.28, the amount consumed being well up toward
2000 tons.
</p>
<p>And yet the big coal bill was one of the least of the evils
of the situation. By driving the engines to the limit
on every mile of the route the weak timbers under the
engines were needlessly strained, with the result that the
engines were racked out of line and torn to pieces. No
sooner did a ship get rid of its passengers at the pier than
an army of machinists came on board to make repairs; and
they were employed in relays, day and night, until the passengers
came to the pier for the next passage.
</p>
<p>"Either the scale upon which it was planned was not
required, and could not be sustained by the country, or it
has been most shamefully mismanaged," said Congressman
Borland, in a speech in the House, on May 17, 1852,
in reference to the Collins Line. Collins had come to Congress
for an increase in the subsidy, and a statement of the
company's affairs which he submitted shows that Borland
was right in both ends of his statement. (See App. <i>Cong.
Globe</i>, 32 Cong. 1 sess.) The statement is dated December
15, 1851. It showed that the expenses for the first
twenty-eight voyages had averaged $65,215.59. The income
was&mdash;for passengers, $21,292.65; freights, $7,744.20,
subsidy, $19,250,&mdash;a total of $48,286.85, leaving a net loss
of $16,928.74 per voyage.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
Because Collins had broken some records, and because
it was believed that his ships would serve in case of war,
and because he had reduced the cost of carrying package
freight, and because Congress heartily hated everything
British, the subsidy was increased to $33,000 per voyage
for twenty-six voyages a year. (Act of March 3, 1854.)
</p>
<p>For a time thereafter Collins was free to continue his
extravagant career. Having luxurious furnishings, he
gained in the cabin passenger trade. He also gained somewhat
in the package freight business. The advent of the
Crimean War (March 27, 1854, to March 31, 1856),
helped him because the British government took and used
several of the Cunard steamers as transports (as <i>war-ships</i>,
even the Cunarders were a sham). The Cunard service
was thereby reduced and he thus had opportunity to sail
in alternate weeks with the remaining Cunarders. But
even then no profits were made. The line never paid a
dividend.
</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Scotchmen were learning to race
their ships, and in 1855 they built the <i>Persia</i>, an iron ship
of 3300 tons, and 3600 actual horse-power; and with her,
in September, 1856, they crossed in 9 days, 2 hours,
and 40 minutes, thus making a new record.
</p>
<p>Collins built the <i>Adriatic</i>, the fifth ship under the contract,
and the records agree that she was a very swift ship,
but by no means a profitable one. Moreover she appeared
too late; for by the act of August 18, 1856, Congress gave
notice to Collins that the subsidy would be reduced, a year

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
later, to the original sum of $19,250 per voyage. At the
same time it became certain that no subsidy would be paid
after the end of the original term of the contract&mdash;ten
years.
</p>
<p>In the meantime the line lost the <i>Arctic</i>. While running
at a speed of thirteen knots an hour through a heavy
fog, forty miles off Cape Race, and making no sort of
signal to notify other vessels of her presence in those waters,
she was rammed by the French steamer <i>Vesta</i>, and sunk
with a loss of 307 lives. It has been asserted that she went
down because the modern system of bulkheads had not
been invented. As a matter of fact, the Norwich liner
<i>Atlantic</i>, a ship built in 1846, had a collision bulkhead,
and other ships had been divided by several bulkheads
before the time of the <i>Arctic</i>, but experience shows that
no system of bulkheads as yet installed has been able
to save a ship when rammed in the engine-room. Then
on September 23, 1856, a little more than a month after
Congress decided to reduce the subsidy, the <i>Pacific</i> sailed
from Liverpool, and was never heard from afterward.
The two ships thus lost were together insured for
$1,250,000, chiefly in England, and the money was paid
to the company.
</p>
<p>The line continued its service after the subsidy was
cut (June 30, 1857), but a financial panic swept over
the commercial world in the fall of that year, and with
the consequent loss of business the line failed. The
last voyage was made in January, 1858. In April, following,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
the sheriff sold the ships (subject to claims of $657,000)
for $50,000. Collins died at his home in Madison Avenue,
New York City, in June, 1878, and was buried in Woodlawn
Cemetery.
</p>
<p>"I knew the Collins line very well.... They burned
an immense quantity of coal; they were fitted out and
fitted up in the most sumptuous manner; they had
large crews, a large number of officers and a large number
of engineers, for they had most powerful engines. They
were run at full speed, and the company had not enough
ships on the line to enable them to have proper relays
so that they began to deteriorate very rapidly, and they ran
them out in a very short time. They had very large
buildings in New York, a great many officers and a great
many people connected with them. All these had to be
paid. Then there were a great many deadheads, so that
I used to be astonished how they kept running at all."
(Admiral Porter, H. R. Rep. 28, 41st Cong. 2 sess. p. 192.)
</p>
<p>Two other lines, subsidized under the act of March 3,
1847, need a brief consideration. One was the Sloo Line,
which, as noted, ran steamships from New York by the
way of Havana, to New Orleans, with a branch line to
Chagres, on the Isthmus of Panama. The subsidy paid
was $290,000 a year. The first ship (the <i>Falcon</i>), left
New York in September, 1848. The Pacific coast contract
went to the Pacific Mail Steamship Company at
$308,000 per year. The first ship on this line left New
York on October 6, 1848.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
In providing for these lines Congress had been influenced
chiefly by a desire to meet the British diplomacy
in establishing the Royal Mail Line to the West Indies,
the Isthmus, and Mexico. But the desire to provide
ships fit for war was also in mind, and some enthusiasts
supposed that the line would in some way increase American
commerce with the countries of the Pacific coast,
especially those at the south of the Isthmus, where an
American named William Wheelwright had established
a coast line with British capital. It is seen now, that
neither of these lines could have made money under the
contracts, and that none of the hopes of Congress would
have been satisfied but for the discovery of gold in California
and the consequent rush of emigrants to the gold-fields.
Because of the traffic thus supplied both lines
were immensely profitable. The Pacific Mail made money
in spite of the fact that coal cost $30 a ton (one lot $50),
and there were no shops anywhere on the coast for the
repair of ships until the company established works of
the kind. In fact, the enormous profits brought unsubsidized
steamers into competition with both the lines. Commodore
C. Vanderbilt, who had earned fame as a steamship
man on the Hudson River and Long Island Sound,
was one of the "interlopers," and he was paid, at one time,
$56,000 a month to keep his ships out of the traffic (<i>Cong.
Globe</i>, June, 1858). The Panama railroad, which was
completed at midnight, January 27, 1855, was built as
a connecting link between these two lines; and one gets

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
an idea of the extent of the traffic thereafter from the fact
that in the first seven years it was operated (including
the traffic on the uncompleted line beginning in 1852)
the earnings amounted to $5,971,728.66 (Otis, <i>Isthmus
of Panama</i>).
</p>
<p>Brief space will suffice for the stories of the unsubsidized
transatlantic steamships of the period. In 1848 the
owners of the Black Ball Line of sailing packets attempted
to substitute steam for sail by building the steamer <i>United
States</i>, a ship of 1904 tons, which they despatched to Liverpool.
But because of the competition of the subsidized
ships it was not possible to make her pay. The subsidized
ships were able to cut rates on all kinds of traffic, of course,
and this was naturally done when the new ship was seeking
cargo.
</p>
<p>This fact seems to be of much importance. It is a
fact beyond dispute that subsidies to a few favored lines
greatly injured all other shipping trading to the same ports&mdash;it
injured British as well as American shipping. In
fact, the British ship-owners, as already noted, were injured
so much that they made emphatic protests to their government,
but they were, in the long run, able to survive the
effects of the unfair practice. In the United States the
paying of subsidies to the few lines simply killed private
enterprise on the North Atlantic.
</p>
<p>In the meantime, Captain R. B. Forbes, of Boston, built
the auxiliary screw steamer <i>Massachusetts</i> (1845), a ship
with full sail-power and a screw that could be lifted out

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
of water when the wind served. She made two voyages
between New York and Liverpool, after which she was
sold to the government for use in the war with Mexico.
A number of ships have been built on this principle since
then, and there are several in the lumber trade on the
Pacific coast at this time (1910), but for some unexplained
reason auxiliaries have never become fashionable.
</p>
<p>In 1850 William Inman, of England, established the
line for which the Philadelphia merchants had hoped in
1837, and two American steamships, the <i>Pioneer</i> and the
<i>City of Pittsburg</i>, made a voyage or two each in the service,
but they were then withdrawn and used in more
profitable traffic on the Pacific coast.
</p>
<p>In 1855 Commodore Vanderbilt offered to establish a
Liverpool line, to run in alternate weeks with the Collins
Line, if a subsidy of $15,000 a voyage were paid him and
he were allowed to make no shorter passages than the
Cunard Line; if Collins Line speed were demanded, he
wanted $19,250 a voyage. This was when Collins was
receiving $33,000. The only result of the offer was to help
turn public sentiment against Collins. Vanderbilt had
already constructed two large steamers (the <i>North Star</i>,
called his yacht, and the <i>Ariel</i>) for use in his Isthmian
competition, and when he failed to get a subsidy contract,
he made a few voyages in the Bremen route and to Havre,
omitting, however, all voyages in the winter months.
With a view of increasing his service he built a still larger
ship, called the <i>Vanderbilt</i>, and he was able to arrange with

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
the Post-office Department for the sea and inland postage
on all mail carried. During the four years (1858-1861)
during which this arrangement lasted, his mail receipts
amounted to $360,730.48, according to Morrison. He
made some money, and it is likely that the service would
have developed into a permanent line but for the Civil
War.

<h2>CHAPTER XV
<br />
<span class="s08">THE CRITICAL PERIOD</span>
</h2>
<p><span class="b20">I</span>F ships under the American flag are ever again to
obtain any share of the deep-water carrying-trade of
the world, it is of the utmost importance that the
American people should learn first of all why American
ships lost the trade they once enjoyed.
</p>
<p>To enable us to comprehend the reasons for the decadence
of our merchant marine it is necessary to have well
in mind the fact that we obtained our supremacy by actual
merit. It was an economic development, not the result
of any kind of political or other stimulation. We did not
gain or hold supremacy because we could build ships
cheaper than they could be built elsewhere. Cheaper
ships could be had in the north of Europe and in Canada.
Moreover our most profitable ships were those that cost
the most per ton. The American ships were supreme,
too, rather because the wages paid were higher then in
spite of that seeming handicap. In short, the whole
environment of the American seafaring population had
evolved a ship and crew which, taken together as a unit,
were able to give more ton-miles for a dollar than any other
similar unit in the world.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
At first the advent of steamships changed these conditions
in but one respect; it gave greater regularity of passage.
The swiftest sailing ships could cross the Atlantic,
now and then, in as short a time as the steamer, and they
carried more cargo at the same time. But the steamer
instantly commanded the cream of the traffic, and received
higher rates for it, because the merchant could calculate,
within a day, the time required for the passage. The time
of even the swiftest of sailing ships was sometimes extended
by adverse winds to fifty or sixty days.
</p>
<p>This is to say that even the first crude steamships took
the best of the trade because they were more efficient.
</p>
<p>With the inevitable improvements in steamships came
an encroachment upon the cheaper traffic that had been
carried on sailing ships, and the most important of these
improvements was made when the screw propeller was
adopted.
</p>
<p>Stevens had driven a small boat with screws before
Fulton built the <i>Clermont</i>, but John Ericsson, a Swede,
was the first to develop screw propulsion in a practical
manner. His first work was done in England, where
he built a screw steamer 45 feet long with which he made
a speed (April, 1837) of ten miles an hour on the Thames.
Then he towed the American packet ship <i>Toronto</i> at a
speed of four and a half miles an hour. On July 7, 1838,
an iron vessel 70 feet long by 10 wide, and having a draft
of 6 feet 9 inches, named the <i>Robert F. Stockton</i>, was
launched at Laird &amp; Co.'s yard, Birkenhead, England,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
for Captain Robert F. Stockton, U. S. N. It was fitted
with an engine and an Ericsson screw. It was then brought
to America under sail, and set to work under steam as
a tug on the Delaware River, where it earned much money
for many years.
</p>
<p>In 1839 Ericsson came to the United States and built
the screw steamship <i>Princeton</i> for our navy, the first warship
of the kind in commission.
</p>
<p>In the meantime Francis P. Smith, an English farmer,
was developing screw propulsion, and succeeded in convincing
the Admiralty that the screw was a practical device,
with the result that many experiments were tried and the
screw was much improved.
</p>
<p>In introducing the screw, two difficulties were encountered.
The engines of the day gave only about twenty-five
revolutions to the minute, and it was therefore necessary
to introduce some sort of multiple gearing between
the engine-shaft and the screw shaft; for a screw should
turn at seventy-five times a minute, or more. The other
defect of screw propulsion was found in the strain of the
shaft upon the stern of the ship. No combination of
timbers in a wooden ship could resist that strain for any
great length of time. To the English, however, this
was a matter of no moment, for iron had already been
used for building hulls. The first of these iron ships was
the <i>Aaron Manby</i>, launched in London, in 1820, but
the iron ship that first really influenced the British merchant
marine was the <i>Great Britain</i>, built for the Great

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
Western Steamship Company at Bristol, in 1843. She
was a big ship for her day (322 feet long), and she was not
only a profitable cargo carrier, but, having been stranded
on the coast of Ireland, she endured the poundings of the
storms of an entire winter, and was then hauled off, repaired
at small expense (considering the storms she had
endured), and when put at work again was found to be
as serviceable as ever.
</p>
<p>As the <i>Great Britain</i> was driven by a screw the use of
iron screw ships soon became fashionable in the British
merchant marine, and the more rapidly because they were
much more economical in the use of coal.
</p>
<p>Lindsay (<i>History of Merchant Shipping</i>) says that the
repeal of the ancient British navigation laws helped to
turn British merchants to the screw steamer. They were
unable to compete with the Americans in the use of sails,
and had to take up the new ship or abandon the sea. The
Cunard Company would have adopted iron ships promptly
but for the contract with the Admiralty. The naval
officers supposed that wooden walls were better for keeping
out shot than iron, and it was not until 1855, as noted,
that this company was allowed to use the best material.
The fact that a subsidy thus restrained enterprise seems
important here.
</p>
<p>For a number of years the iron screw steamer had small
effect upon the transatlantic trade. The owners of the
sailing packets were making as much money as ever&mdash;perhaps
more than ever, for they were building larger

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
ships. In 1850, however, William Inman, an Englishman
who had been interested in sailing ships, put on a line
of iron screw packets between Liverpool and Philadelphia,
as noted, and that line sealed the doom of the sailing
packet. For the Collins, the Bremen, and the Cunard
lines had taken, or were to take, only the cabin passengers
and the express freight from the sailing packets, while
Inman was after the steerage passengers and the coarser
freight. The emigrants were all travelling from Europe
to America. The greater part, in bulk, of the freight
carried across the Atlantic travelled from America to
Europe. Inman filled his ships with emigrants bound
west, and with coarse freight bound east. Having a
cargo both ways is a most important feature of successful
navigation. Inman made money from the first voyage,
and he did so <i>without a penny of subsidy</i>. The <i>City of
Manchester</i>, of his line, made a net profit of 40 per cent
the first year.
</p>
<p>For the sake of emphasis let it be said that our transatlantic
sailing packets lost their trade, not because the
Cunard Company received a subsidy, and not because
Collins lost the subsidy he had been receiving, but because
of the evolution of a cargo carrier that was far more
efficient than the American ship of the sail at its best. And
the Collins and Bremen lines were beaten because they,
too, were much less efficient than their competitors.
</p>
<p>The reader may now ask why the American ship-owner
did not adopt the iron screw steamer. A brief review of

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
the conditions will answer the question. He could secure
all the capital he needed for the well-tried sailing ship,
but no one would advance money for what seemed to be,
then, an experiment with a curious device not yet well
tried out. Almost incredible as the statement may seem
now, the most influential American ship-owners, during
the years before the Civil War, refused to have anything
to do with the screw propeller. In an essay on "Screw
Propulsion in the United States," read before the American
Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers,
at a meeting held in New York in November, 1909, Mr.
Charles H. Cramp, vice-president of the Society, said
(see <i>Shipping Illustrated</i>, November 20, 1909):&mdash;
</p>
<p>"The supremacy of British propulsion practically began
with the advent of the fine screw steamship <i>Great
Britain</i> in 1844, but New York interests would not consider
any other than the paddle-wheel, with its walking-beam
engine; and as they knew nothing of any other
type, they loudly and persistently proclaimed its superiority
over all other types, and carried with them the ship-owners,
shipbuilders, shipping men, mariners, and all others
in general, and the screw propeller was sneered at by them."
</p>
<p>Mr. Cramp, having been a shipbuilder in Philadelphia
during the period considered, spoke from personal knowledge.
</p>
<p>Of equal interest is the state of the iron trade in America
at that time. The clippers that were the pride of the
nation were bolted together with British iron. All the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
large castings used in the Collins steamers were imported
from England. In his essay quoted above, Mr. Cramp
had this to say on iron ship-building:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"A short time after iron construction was introduced
abroad, certain engine builders here commenced iron construction.
The first one in America was built in Kensington
at the boiler works of Jesse Starr, several squares
from the water, and was hauled down there by a large
number of horses and then launched.... The first
iron steamers here were fearful specimens of naval architecture;
the workmen were the boiler-makers of the
works, and the vessels were looked on by these engine-builders
as merely exaggerated boilers. At first they employed
commonplace shipwrights to do certain woodwork
that the vessel needed. The British soon began to build
the entire ship complete by first-class ship-builders, and
the finest specimens of war-ships and merchant ships
were turned out by them. In this country iron ships
were built with their engines by the boiler-makers and
machinists with the most indifferent results."
</p>
<p>Said John Roach, a most noted ship-builder, in testifying
before the committee of Congress that investigated
the state of American shipping in 1869 (H. R. Rep. 28,
41 Cong. 2 sess.):&mdash;
</p>
<p>"The high cost of iron, produced by the tariff upon it,
was one of the principal difficulties that our commerce
had to contend with.... If Congress will take off all
the duties from American iron, reducing it to the price

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
of foreign iron, then we are prepared to compete with
foreign ship-builders. The labor question is misstated.
We are prepared to meet that difficulty, and to ask no
further legislation upon the subject."
</p>
<p>The tariff was not as high before the war as it was after,
but the inability of the American ship-builder to obtain
iron at home for any purpose at a living price had
great influence in preventing the adoption of iron screw
steamers.
</p>
<p>Of the influence of lack of experience in building sea-going
steamships, something more must be said here, and
leading authorities of the period shall tell the facts:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"Hitherto our steamboats have been built for short and
comparatively unstormy voyages. The navigation of the
Atlantic is quite a different affair from that of the Hudson
or the Erie. Now in England they have had the practical
experience of thirty-six years in building <i>sea-going</i>
steamers." (<i>Scientific American</i>, October 7, 1848.)
</p>
<p>Charles H. Cramp, another noted ship-builder, when
testifying before the committee of Congress mentioned
above said:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"Great Britain now had the advantage of this country
in the carrying trade of the world, not because the vessels
constructed were superior to ours <i>in model</i>, but <i>because
of the great superiority of their marine engines</i>. The
English have built the finest and best marine engines in
the world. <i>We have always been inferior to her in that
respect.</i>"
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
Senator Rusk, of Texas, who was chairman of the
Senate "Committee on the Post Office and the Post
Roads," in the course of a report made to the Senate
under date of June 15, 1852, described at some length
the difficulties under which the Collins Line was then laboring
in spite of the subsidy it was receiving. In laying
special stress upon the expense of running these ships he
said that it was in part due to "the well-known fact that,
at the period when they were commenced, there were no
machine shops in this country in which castings of the
size required could be made, <i>nor were there on this side
of the Atlantic, experienced practical engineers competent
to take charge of marine engines of such immense size</i>....
It is not to be supposed that engines of such vast dimensions
could have been constructed in a country <i>where
there were, as yet, no workshops adapted to the purpose</i> and
where labor is very high, as cheaply as in a country where
every appliance of the kind already existed and where
the prices of labor are proverbially low. <i>Nor can it be
reasonably imagined that vessels of this description could
have been navigated upon as good terms by men taken from
this country.</i>" (Sen. Rep. Com. 267, 32 Cong. 1 sess. pp.
3-4).
</p>
<p>That the iron screw steamer was steadily driving all
American ships from the sea, was plainly seen several
years before the war, and sufficient warnings were printed
in the periodicals of the day. Said the <i>Scientific American</i>
on May 16, 1857:&mdash;
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
"There are no less than thirty steamships now running
between New York and different ports in Europe. These
are regular steamers carrying passengers and merchandise,
beside which <i>there are a number of transient ones that carry
cargo only</i>. But ten of them are American vessels, while
the Boston, Portland, and Philadelphia lines are entirely
European. <i>The Atlantic trade is departing from us</i>, and
unless our shipping merchants exhibit more practical
wisdom and enterprise <i>they will ultimately be vanished
in this contest</i>. The whole number of steamships engaged
upon the routes between Philadelphia, New York, Boston,
Portland, Halifax, and Quebec, on this side of the Atlantic
and the ports of Havre, Bremen, Hamburg, Southampton,
London, Liverpool, and Glasgow, on the other side, is
fifty-one. Of these only seventeen have paddle-wheels:
all the others&mdash;thirty-four&mdash;are <i>screw propellers with
iron hulls</i>. They are the most economical of steamships;
their steam power is but small in proportion to their tonnage;
they make very regular and quick passages, carry
large cargoes, charge but little more freight than sailing
vessels, and <i>merchants prefer them for carrying goods</i>.
<i>These</i> are the steamers that are fast 'routing out' our
sailing craft in the Atlantic trade."
</p>
<p>Of the foreign ships mentioned above, only the <i>Cunard</i>
received a subsidy.
</p>
<p>That was in 1857. On March 31, 1860, the <i>Scientific
American</i> again referred to the subject:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"Three years ago we directed attention to the great

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
increase of foreign screw steamers, and showed clearly
how they were rapidly taking away the trade that had been
formerly carried by American ships.... Our merchants
did not heed this injunction, and, as a consequence,
their rivals have grown stronger, while they have become
weaker. To-day nearly all the mail and passenger, besides
a great deal of the goods, traffic, is carried by foreign
ships, <i>the great majority of which are iron screw steamers</i>.
These facts are indisputable; how can we account for
them but upon the theory that iron screw steamers are
the cheapest and best for the traffic?... We exhort our
shipping merchants to examine the question candidly for
themselves, ... for we assure them that 'the Philistines
are upon them!' We have not a single new Atlantic steamship
on the stocks, from one end of the country to the other,
while in Great Britain there are 16,000 tons of new iron
screw steamers building for the American trade."
</p>
<p>It was in those days that the "New York interests,"
as Mr. Cramp says, "carried with them the ship-owners,
ship-builders, shipping men, mariners, and all others in
general," while they sneered at the screw propeller.
</p>
<p>Other quotations to show how and why the British
secured supremacy are worth making. Said the <i>Nautical
Magazine</i> (New York) for February, 1856, regarding
two steamers that had been compared in all particulars:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"The extraordinary fact which presses itself upon our
notice from the foregoing details by trials consists in the
difference in power required in the two vessels to produce

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
nearly identical speed ... 2050 H. P., economized by
the screw, propelled the <i>Himalaya</i> at about the same
speed as 3016 H. P., transmitted by paddles, propelled the
<i>Atrato</i>."
</p>
<p>The <i>New York Journal of Commerce</i> published the
following warning in 1857:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"While we are learning [to build steamships] England
is using her advantages. Their merchants, captains, engineers,
and sailors are carrying on our trade, and taking
the bread from our mouths."
</p>
<p>Congressman Nelson Dingley, Jr., of Maine, a prominent
advocate of the subsidy system, in an article in the <i>North
American Review</i>, dated April, 1884, said:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"At the time Great Britain accepted our invitation to
participate, on equal terms in the business of" transportation
(it was in 1849), "experiments in iron ship building
and steam propulsion were going on in that country,
which, <i>as early as 1855, began to work a revolution in marine
architecture</i>.... <i>This revolution</i> from wood to iron
and sails to steam <i>at once</i> began to deprive the American
merchant marine of" the advantages it had enjoyed.
</p>
<p>The total number of British steamers receiving mail pay,
or subsidy, in 1857, was 121, including the vessels plying
to Ireland, the Isle of Man, the Orkneys, and other near-by
points; among which was one line sending two steamers
a day over its route. (See <i>Nautical Magazine</i>, September,
1857.) The total number of steamers under the
British flag, in 1857, was 2132 (Rep. Com. of Nav. for

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
1901, p. 472). It is manifest that the mail pay aided
the 121 steamers thus favored; it is equally manifest that
the 2011 unsubsidized steamers were not only obliged to
depend on their intrinsic merit for profit, but they were
obliged to compete on unfair terms in all the trades (like
that from Liverpool to New York) where the subsidized
steamers were employed.
</p>
<p>The progress made by the British iron screw steamer
thereafter was pointed out by John Roach, in the course
of his testimony, quoted above, when he said (p. 177)
he "had found out by personal examination that there
were 119 iron steamships plying between the ports of
America and Great Britain. Of that number 110 were
running to the port of New York."
</p>
<p>A brief space must be given to a commonly accepted
statement to the effect that the members of Congress from
the South, in the decade before the Civil War, were
opposed to the payment of subsidies to American steamers
because of prejudice against the North. Marvin, in the
<i>American Merchant Marine</i>, names Jefferson Davis and
three of the men who were afterwards associated with him
in his cabinet as president of the Confederacy, as leaders
in this assault upon a Northern industry. The reader who
is interested in making a candid study of the facts can find
many speeches made by Congressmen from all parts of the
country, in the <i>Globe</i> for the period in question. Part III,
for 1857-1858, will be found most interesting in connection
with this charge against Mr. Davis. On page 2832, third

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
column, are the following words uttered by him (he was
then a senator), on the method of paying subsidies:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"Having established the mail line the question is, how
shall the compensation be stated. In one of these amendments
it seems it is to be the postal receipts. I think
that altogether an objectionable method, and I shall vote
against that amendment for the reason that this is to be a
fluctuating amount.... The company cannot bear the
fluctuation. The depression of commerce, the existence
of war, or some other cause, may limit the correspondence,
and cut off passenger and light freight, and then a line
relying on postage receipts might not be able to run; whilst
if the government allowed from year to year a fixed sum
... it might keep up the line."
</p>
<p>Later Mr. Davis voted as he had talked. It is but fair
to say that he, together with other senators and members of
Congress, believed that the payment of subsidies, as a
national policy, was objectionable, but so, too, did Ben
Wade of Ohio, and other pronounced opponents of the
"slave oligarchy." Senator Rusk, of Texas, was as firm
in his support of the utterly reckless Collins Line as was
Seward of New York.
</p>
<p>The assertion, so often made at the North, that Congressmen
from the Southern States, during the years
immediately preceding the Civil War, were united in a
conspiracy to injure Northern industries in order thereby
to weaken the North and make the work of secession
easier, is absolutely without foundation in fact. It is

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
as absurd as the similar statement to the effect that the
Secretary of the Navy (Toucey, a Connecticut man) had
scattered the ships of the navy all over the world to
weaken the fighting power of the general government.
The truth is the ships were not as badly scattered in
1860 as they had been in several of the preceding years.
Thus there were twelve ships upon the home station in
1860, but only five in 1851. Further than that, Toucey
had for two years urged upon Congress the building of
seven sloops of war of a draught of only fourteen feet,
and Congress, on February 21, 1861, appropriated the
money for that purpose. These shoal-draught vessels were
admirably adapted for use in the waters along the
Southern States, and that fact was pointed out during
the discussion in the House. <i>Nevertheless several members
from the Southern States voted for the bill.</i>
</p>
<p>The subsidy policy was never treated as a sectional
issue in Congress. Hamlin, of Maine, Vice-president under
Lincoln, voted with the opponents of the subsidy men.
(<i>Globe</i>, June 9, 1858, p. 2837.)
</p>
<p>Hamlin's opposition is especially significant because he
represented the great mass of unsubsidized ship-owners
whose business was injured by the subsidized ships, and
who were hot in their opposition to Collins.
</p>
<p>Then it is to be noted that a chief argument urged by
these Southern men against the payment of subsidies to
the lines then in question was based on the belief that the
ships were not fit for war-ships&mdash;were, in that respect,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
the shams they are now known to have been. In short,
any candid reading of the speeches shows that in this
question they were inspired by a desire to do what was
best for the whole nation.
</p>
<p>That one kind of sectional jealousy hurt the Collins
line has been pointed out by Smith, in <i>The Ocean Carrier</i>&mdash;the
well-founded jealousy of the ship-owners of Boston,
Philadelphia, and Baltimore. The clipper ship-owners
of New York also bitterly opposed the Collins Line. In
fact, these unsubsidized ship-owners combined to fight the
Collins lobby at Washington, and it was their influence
that struck the "terrible blow" which Marvin says was
inflicted by the Southern members of Congress.
</p>
<p>The influence of the Civil War upon the merchant
marine must now have consideration. First of all, the
appearance of Confederate privateers upon the ocean at
once doubled the rate of insurance on all American merchantmen.
Then, when Commander J. D. Bullock, of
the Confederate navy, was sent to England to buy iron-clad
war-ships with which to raise the blockade of Confederate
ports, and was induced to build swift cruisers
with which to raid the North's merchant marine, a still
heavier blow was struck. In all, the Confederates had
19 cruisers at sea, and they captured 257 merchantmen.
The loss of these ships, however, was the smallest
part of the injury suffered. The possibility of capture
deprived American ships of the opportunity to obtain
cargoes, and led to a cessation of building in American

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
shipyards. It led many owners to transfer their vessels
to foreign flags. It changed the currents of commerce.
Naturally the British merchants took every advantage of
their opportunity, as the Americans had done in the
troubled days of the war with Napoleon.
</p>
<p>One might suppose that the demand for naval ships
would have given prosperity to the shipyards and engine
works, but John Roach testified before the committee mentioned
that "out of ten marine engine shops that were in
existence in New York at the commencement of the war,
his was the only one remaining in existence."
</p>
<p>Though iron was largely used in the government ships,
Nathaniel McKay, the ship-builder, told this committee
that "<i>we have got to have some experience in building iron
ships</i>. We have built but few iron ships, and most of them
were failures."
</p>
<p>Mere mention only of the transfer of American capital
from the sea to the shore need be made here. With the
depreciated currency there was plenty of opportunity for
"wildcat" speculations; for government contracts, and for
other kinds of investments more to the taste of honest capitalists.
</p>
<p>The whole seafaring population spent the war period in
acquiring new habits, while the British ship-builders were
busy perfecting their arts, and the British merchants were
establishing themselves firmly in the trades from which the
war drove the Americans.
</p>
<p>As a final reason for the decadence of the American merchant

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
marine, note that the conditions of life in the American
forecastle had greatly changed, and that this change
began when the American ships were winning their laurels.
With the advent of the packet system the "private venture"
method of adding to a sailor's income disappeared, and
with it one strong inducement to the young men who
thought of going to sea. Then the old custom of making
the forecastle a schoolroom, with the ship's officers serving
as instructors in navigation, died out. The very prosperity
of the American merchant marine served to deteriorate
the quality of American seamen, for the number of ships
increased much more rapidly than the seafaring population.
Foreign sailors were employed for lack of enough Americans.
In time even the number of experienced foreigners
was insufficient. Captain J. S. Clark testified before the
committee of Congress mentioned above that he had taken
a ship to sea with "but two men out of a crew of sixty who
could steer."
</p>
<p>With the employment of foreigners the pleasant relations
that had existed between the forecastle and cabin came to
an end. The officers who had been shipmates with crews
of ambitious young Americans found the foreign sailors,
with their lack of ambition&mdash;with a certain slowness of
movement, in fact&mdash;exasperating, especially when topsails
were to be reefed after "carrying on" somewhat too
long! This exasperation, with race or national prejudices to
increase it, was what led to the use of the belaying pin and
the pump-brake for the "encouragement" of sailors who

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
failed to "show willing." Naturally, as time passed, the
treatment of sailors grew worse, and an American statute
which required the sailor to prove malice or revenge on the
part of an assailing officer, when he had the officer arrested
for ill treatment, did but add to the horrors of a passage on a
driven ship. Dana, in his <i>Two Years Before the Mast</i>,
describes mildly the treatment which common sailors received
in American ships in his day. Jewell's <i>Among
Our Sailors</i> describes the cruelty more in detail. It was
a common thing for captains to torture men, and men
were sometimes killed by the brutality which they could not
escape. And while the conditions in the American forecastle
were growing worse, those in the British were growing
better. In 1869 Captain Cyrus F. Sargeant, the well-known
ship-owner, testified that "the wages of sailors are
lower in an American ship than in an English ship." It
is well known that the port makes the wages for the forecastle,
but it was true, then, that seamen on British liners,
at least, saved more money in a year than the men on
American ships.
</p>
<p>The testimony taken before the Merchant Marine Commission,
in 1904 (p. 1263), contains the following paragraph,
the truthfulness of which was not disputed:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"The condition of sea life under the American flag repels
the American, boy and man. These conditions are mainly&mdash;we
might say solely&mdash;due to the state of the navigation
laws of the country. These laws are antiquated and
disgraceful, compared to American standards: they were

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
designed to govern slaves, and are maintained for the purpose
of making slaves. No American boy with any spunk
in him will submit himself to the conditions created by the
maritime law, except (as frequently happens) as the alternative
of a term in prison. Take any trade that now attracts
the American boy and now holds the American adult,
apply to those who follow it a special code of laws obnoxious
to all conceptions of Americanism, repugnant to the
dictates of humanity and condemned by the instincts of
decency, and it may be regarded as certain that that trade
would speedily be shunned by American labor. And if
consulted about it the American people would be very likely
to declare that if such laws are really necessary to the
continuance of the trade in question, it would be a mercy to
let the trade die in order to be rid of the laws.... To
create a healthy popular interest in the whole subject of
American shipping it is necessary to alter the laws affecting
American seamen, thus, by inducing Americans to accept
service at sea, creating an interest in the vital element
of the subject, and also by reflex action, in the physical
considerations involved."
</p>
<p>This matter is of much importance here because, while
life at sea was becoming absolutely unendurable, by a self-respecting
American youth,&mdash;in an American ship, that
is,&mdash;the opportunities for a career on shore were becoming
more alluring. The young men who might have become
leaders in our seafaring population&mdash;who might, perhaps,
have found a way to maintain our supremacy at sea&mdash;were

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
forced to suppress a natural liking for salt water; so
they took the farms which the government gave away too
freely; or they raised cattle on the unfenced plains; or they
located mines; or they became managers and owners of
factories where "protected" goods were made; or they
obtained power and fortune from the railroads. While the
British were strengthening their hold upon the sea, the
Americans were steadily losing the sea habit.
</p>
<p>It is manifest from any candid review of the facts that the
decadence of the American merchant marine was wholly
due to natural causes&mdash;to conditions of national development
(the Civil War was a feature of our national development)
that were unavoidable. It is unpleasant, but absolutely
necessary, to face the facts. When the American
merchant marine lost the command of the sea and the
British gained it, the result was due to the working of the
immutable law of the survival of the fittest.

<h2>CHAPTER XVI
<br />
<span class="s08">DURING A HALF CENTURY OF DEPRESSION</span>
</h2>
<p><span class="b20">I</span>N 1866, just after the end of the Civil War, the American
steam fleet registered for foreign trade, measured
198,289 tons. The steam vessels enrolled for coasting
traffic measured 885,223 tons. In 1879 the steam tonnage
in the foreign trade had fallen to 156,323, while the coasting
tonnage had passed the million mark. In 1896 the
coasting fleets measured more than 2,000,000 tons, while
the foreign trade ships measured 264,289 tons. In 1908
the coasting steamers reached a tonnage of 4,055,295,&mdash;double
the figures of 1896, and the registered tonnage was
598,737,&mdash;more than double that of 1896, but so far below
that of the coasting tonnage as to warrant a serious inquiry
into the causes which had created the contrast.
</p>

</p>
<p class="caption">First steel ship built in the United States
</p>
</div>
<p>Before entering into this inquiry, however, it will be of
interest to consider several features of the growth of the
coasting traffic. First note that the cheap rates of transportation
afforded by the ships running from such Southern
ports as Savannah, Charleston, and Norfolk to Boston and
New York have had a most remarkable influence upon
the agriculture of the Southern coast States. Where once
cotton only was raised, or cotton and tobacco, the land-owners

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
are producing cargoes of vegetables at a season
when such truck can be produced at the North only by the
use of hothouses. The health of millions of people at the
North, and the prosperity of other millions at the South,
have been greatly promoted by the coasting steamers.
At the same time the coast lines of railroads, to secure a
share of the traffic which was originated by steamers, have
improved their service so far that strawberries and string
beans have right of way over passengers.
</p>
<p>A natural evolution of traffic alongshore has been seen in
the extension, so to speak, of the railroads across both salt
and fresh water. Soon after the Boston and Providence
Railroad was opened (June 15, 1835), its directors made
an agreement with a line of steamers to New York under
which the vessels of rival lines were excluded from the terminal
facilities of the railroad, and the passengers from the
rival lines had to wait hours for a train on which to continue
their journey. In 1845 Daniel Drew, a director of the
Providence and Stonington Railroad, became the president
of the line of steamers running from Stonington to New
York, and the two companies, for the purposes of traffic,
were operated as one.
</p>
<p>The railroads that terminated on the shores of Lake
Erie engaged in the Lake traffic at an early date by establishing
ship lines that gathered freight at all Lake ports of importance
for transportation to the East, and, of course,
carried the traffic from the East to the farthest points
on the Lakes. These steamers had a marked influence on

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
the development of the West. Of such lines as that which
runs from Galveston and New Orleans to New York in
connection with the Southern Pacific Railroad, only mention
need be made, but the fact that the extension of railroads
in this way across wide stretches of the waters of the
country, has had a marked influence upon the prosperity
of the country as well as upon that of the railroads, is
memorable.
</p>
<p>Another notable feature of the coasting trade is a revival
of the old system, practised by such merchants as Derby,
of Salem, when they built ships especially to carry their own
goods to market. Thus, when petroleum was found in
Texas, the Standard Oil Company built many vessels to
carry the crude oil from the wells to the refineries at New
York. The oil was taken through pipes from the wells to
the ship, and it was pumped from the ship into tanks at the
refineries. With the aid of such port facilities the cost of
transportation was reduced to the lowest figure.
</p>
<p>The United States Steel Corporation, owning ore beds near
Lake Superior and mills near Pittsburg, built a fleet of
ships to carry the ore to points on Lake Erie whence it could
be shipped on a private railroad to the mills. The ore in
the beds was scooped up with steam shovels and dumped
into cars, by which it was transported to high trestles on the
edge of the harbor. On the trestles it was dumped into
pockets, from which it fell through chutes into the vessel,
the hatches of which were spaced to correspond with the
spaces of the chutes. A cargo of more than 10,000 tons

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
has been loaded in two hours. At the port of discharge
other scoops (a sort of dredge), made to operate through
the hatches, lift the cargo out of the ship at a rate of more
than a thousand tons an hour.
</p>
<p>The great coal companies of the East deliver their coal
in similar pockets on the coast, but they transport a large
portion of it thence to the consumer by means of tugs and
barges. In proportion to the coal carried, the tug-and-barge
system costs less than cargo-carrying steamers. The
tugs, with their high-priced crews, are kept moving; they
tow the barges in "strings" to their destinations, dropping
one here and another there, until the last is at the pier.
Then they return, picking up the barges that have been unloaded,
and take them to the pockets for more coal. The
barges have small crews of low-priced men. The expense of
waiting for the discharge of the coal is therefore less than
if a steamer had carried the coal; it is even less than the
expense of a schooner lying thus. The systems of handling
cargoes in coarse freight trades of the American coast
are, perhaps, the most perfect in the world.
</p>
<p>Naturally, extensions of the railroad lines have been
made across deep water. The Pennsylvania Railroad established
the American line from Philadelphia to Liverpool
in 1871. The Baltimore and Ohio established the Atlantic
Transport line to Europe. The Louisville and Nashville
created lines from Pensacola to several countries, including
Japan and China. The Illinois Central has lines
from New Orleans. The Occidental and Oriental Steamship

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
Company was organized to carry the freight of the
Pacific railroads from San Francisco to the Far East.
Near the end of the nineteenth century the Southern Pacific
Railroad bought an interest in the Pacific Mail. The
Northern Pacific was served for years by the Boston Steamship
Company, and the Great Northern Railroad built two
of the largest cargo carriers in the world for an extension of
service across the Pacific. Most of the ships in these extensions
of railroads have been of American build.
</p>
<p>In oversea traffic the through bills of lading and special
terminal facilities gave the ships owned by railroads special
advantages in the world's traffic. A great corporation is
able to purchase supplies at the lowest prices. Further
than that, it is not infrequently advisable to carry freight
on ships at an actual loss in order to provide freight for the
cars in which it can be carried with profit.
</p>
<p>Another American adventure at sea that is of interest
here was the evolution of the United Fruit Company. Individual
dealers in perishable products of the tropics found
it profitable to unite in gathering bananas and other fruits,
and in chartering ships to bring them to the United States.
As the business continued to increase, the need of swift
ships, and for fittings to preserve the fruit in the best condition,
led to the building of special kinds of ships (chiefly
under foreign flags) and of machinery for loading and unloading
the cargoes at the terminals. In the meantime, the
speedy ships employed had proved attractive to passengers,
and because passengers could be carried without

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
decreasing the efficiency of the ships as fruit carriers, efforts
were made to increase this branch of the traffic. In time
the company built hotels for the comfort of the passengers
at points in the tropics where a comfortable hotel was
a surprise to the experienced traveller. Then because the
well-contented fruit farmers of the tropics were unwilling
to keep up with the demands of the trade in either the
quantity or the quality of the fruit, the company bought
land and produced the cargoes needed by their ships.
</p>
<p>The Standard Oil Company employs nearly a hundred
ships (chiefly under foreign flags), which it has built for
the purpose, to transport its products to foreign countries.
And there are other corporations that own ships as parts
of their business equipment.
</p>
<p>These American enterprises are of the utmost importance
to the story of the American merchant marine, because
they are the most modern features of our water-borne
traffic. The great corporation is doing an <i>ever growing</i>
share of the world's work, and the growth is an economic
evolution that must be forwarded as well as controlled.
In spite of the prevailing fear of great aggregations of
wealth, it is worth while to inquire whether a further combination
of corporate interests might not help on a revival
of the American merchant marine. Suppose that a ship-building
"trust" were united with the steel-making "trust"
and the aggregation were to make a traffic agreement with
a combination of railroads extending from the Atlantic
to the Pacific, under which special low freight rates were

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
obtainable; is it not conceivable that this powerful corporation
might solve the problem of ships able to compete on
deep water? Although the law now prohibits such combinations
as this, may we not hope that the American
people will yet learn how to preserve themselves from
oppression, and the fear of it, without hampering the
men who are able and eager to do the world's work on
the world's terms?
</p>
<p>In any consideration of a revival of the American merchant
marine, it is necessary to view candidly the conditions
which our ships must face. Emphasis is laid upon the need
of candor, because in such discussions of the matter as have
been had in periodicals, and before committees of Congress,
the plainest facts of history have been frequently
misstated, and, at times, deliberately misrepresented. If
one-half the ingenuity and energy that have been used in
arguing for the subsidy policy had been expended in evolving
a revolution-making type of ship, we should have had,
long since, a merchant marine worthy of the flag. Further
than that, while an appeal to sentiment is justified, the
matter ought to be viewed first as a cold matter of business.
</p>
<p>Is the deep-water carrying trade worth the attention of
American capitalists? It is a curious fact that in the
hearings before the committees of Congress that have investigated
the state of our shipping since the Civil War,
not one word has been said about the dividends paid by
the ocean carriers of the world. The reports of the committees
assume that there is great profit in such shipping.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
One adroit advocate of the subsidy system says "the
European steamship combinations ... now derive an
income of about $200,000,000 a year from their control
of our carrying trade" (<i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, October, 1909),
leaving the reader to suppose that that great sum is divided
as net profits.
</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the International Mercantile Marine
Company, one of the larger corporations thus engaged
(it is largely in the hands of American capitalists, too),
has paid no dividends as yet (1909), and even its bonds
sell below par. When the Cunard Company wished to
build two ships to excel the swiftest of the German liners,
it was unable to do so until the British government loaned
it the necessary capital under conditions that amounted
to a gift of the total cost of the ships. According to the
<i>Financial Times</i> (London), dated Wednesday, April 14,
1909, the highest dividend paid by this most highly favored
of all the British subsidized lines during the last fourteen
years (1895-1908) was 8 per cent, which was distributed
in 1900. The average distribution for the fourteen years
has been 3.17 per cent a year. In 1895, instead of making
a profit, the company lost £40,000. In 1904 there was a loss
of £66,700. In 1908, while operating the two splendid
and thoroughly well-advertised record breakers which
it had received as a free gift from the British government
(the <i>Mauretania</i> and <i>Lusitania</i>), it made the enormous
loss of £249,800. A letter from the company to the writer
admits that these figures are correct.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
Said James A. Patton, then one of the foremost grain
exporters of the United States, in a hearing before the
Merchant Marine Commission of Congress in 1904 (Sen.
Rep. 2755, 58 Cong. 3 sess. p. 714):&mdash;
</p>
<p>"The ocean freight market has been so low during the
past two years that at times the ship agents have offered
to transport grain to Liverpool and London for nothing,
to take it as ballast. Recently we have shipped corn from
Boston to London at a price less than that ... less than
nothing, owing to duties the port dues in London, which
absorbed more than the freight rate received."
</p>
<p>The conditions described by Mr. Patton are out of the
ordinary, of course, but conditions which have kept the
dividends of the well-subsidized Cunard Company under
3 per cent have prevailed for thirteen years. The company
was able to earn the 8 per cent dividend in 1900 only
because the war with the Boers created an extraordinary
demand for ships to be used as transports, and these having
been taken from the general carrying-trade freight rates
rose to an abnormal point. Leaving out the abnormal
dividend of 1900, the average distribution has been but
2.8 per cent.
</p>
<p>The ocean carrying-trade is performed by two distinct
classes of services; the line traffic, like that of the Cunard
Company, and the independent cargo carrier or tramp service.
The tramp will go anywhere and at any time for a
charter price. The income received by the tramps is as
uncertain as that of a prospector in the mining region.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
In spite of the ease with which the demand for tonnage is
telegraphed around the world the tramps accumulate on
this or that coast in numbers far beyond all needs of the
trade, and rates drop to a point where many of them are
glad to get away in ballast. At such a time, however, a
lucky (perhaps a far-seeing) owner has a ship at a port
barren of tonnage, and receives for a cargo that must go
quickly a price that pays half the cost of the ship. It is
the lucky stroke that keeps the seafaring people hoping
against hope, just as the prospector remembers how
Creede, of Colorado, made a million out of the Amethyst.
</p>
<p>Then consider the effect of the tides in the business
world upon the carrying-trade. After the war with the
Boers the freight rates went to pieces. Owners ceased
building new tonnage. The ship-builders, to keep their
forces together, offered to construct the best of modern
vessels at cost of construction. Thereupon new capital
came into the trade, and some men of experience also
placed orders. In this way an excess of tonnage was kept
afloat. Meantime much old tonnage in the progressive
countries like England and Germany was placed on the
market at forced sale, and these ships were bought by
continental owners who patched them up ("cheap repairs
for the cheap ones"), and sent them, with cheap
crews, looking for cargoes. It must be kept in mind that
Chinese owners, who can hire stokers at $6 a month, are
competing in the world's traffic, as well as owners who have
to pay $40 a month for the same kind of work. Where

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
the Chinese owner can make money, and the owner of the
best of modern freighters can live, and even make a lucky
stroke, now and then, the owner of the average tramp keeps
her running because the losses while she is in commission
are less than when she is laid up in ordinary. The tramp
traffic is precisely like mining in that the luck of the few
keeps the many trying. Moreover the trend of business
has been, for some time, away from tramps and into regular
line ships, and that is a fact worth serious consideration.
</p>
<p>The average profit of the lines of steamers is well set
forth in the statement of the Cunard Company, unless,
indeed, that statement is more favorable than the average
facts warrant. The Hamburg-American Line dividends
during the past fourteen years have averaged 5¾ per cent
per annum, and it is likely that but one other ship-owning
corporation has done as well on deep water. It is a
world's traffic even for a line that plies between New York
and Liverpool only. The price that a Swedish tramp will
accept for wheat in the River Plate, and the rate which the
Japanese will accept on the coast of China, both affect the
North German Lloyd at Bremen. A few lines, especially
those having special trades, make good dividends. The
United Fruit Company's ships are among the exceptions
because of the peculiarities of the business. But every
ship-owner knows that on the average there is no great part
of the world's work that pays smaller dividends than carrying
cargoes across deep water.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
The people of the United States, before taxing themselves
to add to the congestion upon the high seas, should
ask themselves whether success, when attained, will be
worth the cost. Would a sensible American farmer,
able to earn $3 a day grafting orchards, work overtime
in order to compete with a foreign ditch digger receiving
$1.50?
</p>
<p>If we decide to make the fight for a share of the business
of the sea it will then be of the utmost importance to consider
the strength of the opposition to be overcome. In
this inquiry no account will be taken of ships of the sail.
For while schooners fit to carry from 3000 up to perhaps
10,000 tons' dead weight came into use in the coast coal
trade at the end of the nineteenth century, and proved
profitable, it is absurd to think of any kind of sailing
ship in connection with future traffic on deep water.
</p>
<p>According to the last Report of the Commissioner of
Navigation (1908), the United Kingdom had, in 1907,
4105 steamships, measuring 9,156,356 tons, with crews
aggregating 185,867 men (this "includes masters as well
as Asiatics and Lascars"), in the foreign trade, besides
239 ships of 240,983 tons, manned by 5362 men, engaged
partly in the home, and partly in the foreign, trade. The
tonnage of 1907 was about four times as great as it was
in 1880.
</p>
<p>The German Empire had, in 1908, 2521 steamships,
of 4,070,242 tons, manned by 65,568 men. This tonnage
was twice as large as the tonnage of 1900.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
In 1908 the Japanese had 626 steamships of 1,076,070
tons, which was twice the tonnage registered in 1900. The
number of men in the fleet is not given, but it was at least
16,000.
</p>
<p>The steamships of the world, exclusive of those of the
United States, measured, in 1906, more than 30,000,000
tons. Perhaps 800,000 men were employed on these
ships, and there was an experienced force of owners and
managers on shore to look after the interests of the fleet.
</p>
<p>The quality of this vast sea power must now be considered.
In this point of view it is a most discouraging fact
that about all important improvements of recent years in the
steam engine have been made by Europeans. Between 1855
and 1865 steam pressures in boilers ranged from 20 to
35 pounds per square inch, and the consumption of fuel
was about 3 pounds per horse-power-hour. Compound
engines came into general use between 1865 and 1875,
when boiler pressures rose to 125 pounds, and the consumption
of fuel decreased to 2.2 pounds and even less.
Between 1885 and 1895 twin screws and quadruple expansion
engines were adopted for the swiftest ships, and
the improved engines were used on many cargo carriers.
Boiler pressures reached 225 pounds and upward, and
the coal consumption dropped as low as 1.4 pounds.
Then came the far-reaching change to the steam turbine,
on ships of 14 knots and upward. For slower ships the
turbine in combination with reciprocating engines has
been found more efficient than the old-style engines, while

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
a combination of the turbine with the dynamo for still
slower ships is now in hand and sure to make headway.
In all these matters Europe has taken the lead.
</p>
<p>In the turbine, with its combinations, it is believed that
the steam-engine reaches its highest possible efficiency,
just as sails reached their highest efficiency as used on the
American clipper. But a new machine, still more economical,
has been invented&mdash;the gas motor. Coal is used
for the generation of gas, which drives internal-combustion
motors, much like those seen on automobiles. The consumption
of fuel is thereby reduced far below that of steam
engines.
</p>
<p>While the marine steam-engine has been perfected in
Europe, it is worth noting by the way that the producer-gas
engine, though yet in the experimental stage for ship
use, has been brought to a higher state of perfection for
land use in America than in Europe. Magazine articles
by marine engineers have been published, urging American
ship-owners to adopt this new method of propulsion,
because it is to make a revolution almost as far-reaching
as the iron screw steamer made in 1855. But the American
ship-owner refuses to see his opportunity. Having certain
profits with old-style engines in the coasting trade, he is
willing to let foreigners do the experimenting.
</p>
<p>All of this is to say that the ship-owners of foreign
countries are at least as far-sighted and enterprising as
those of the United States.
</p>
<p>Some of the facts in the story of our coasting steamer

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
trade are of interest in this point of view. The most
interesting division of this fleet is found upon the Great
Lakes. The screw propeller and the compound engine
were successfully introduced on the Great Lakes before
1850&mdash;several years before the iron screw steamer of
the British began its deadly inroads upon our salt-water
trade&mdash;but the Atlantic coast remained indifferent.
</p>
<p>After the Civil War tugs came into use for towing the
sailing vessels through the Detroit and Huron rivers,
and from these the use of barges in "strings" behind
steamers that carried cargoes as well as served as tugs,
was developed. This system ruled upon the lakes until
the evolution of the iron ore trade led to the building of
ships so large that they were unable to handle barges. In
1902 the ship able to carry 10,000 tons arrived.
</p>
<p>Still larger ships have been built since 1902. A ship
that can carry 12,000 tons' dead weight needs but thirty-five
men, all told. The average cost of carrying freight on the
best ships of the lakes is less than .8 of a mill per ton-mile.
Through natural development this splendid efficiency has
been attained, and the fleet in 1908 numbered 1942 ships
measuring 2,341,686 tons.

<p class="caption"><a id="Ill14"></a><span class="smcap">Seven-masted Schooner <i>THOMAS LAWSON</i></span>
</p>
</div>
<p>A feature of these ships to be considered is that they are
all built for passing through certain shoal channels, the
Welland Canal, and the canal at the rapids at the outlet of
Lake Superior, for example. These channels have compelled
the designers to adopt one cross-section of hull for
all ships (at least below the water-line), and that cross-section

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
is the largest that will pass through the channels.
Because of this similarity of models the lake builders have
been able to carry specialization in the work of construction
as far as any builders in the world, and much further than
it is carried in the Atlantic coast yards, where builders may
have a battleship, a harbor tug, and a side-wheel passenger
boat on adjoining ways. The lake ships can be built for
the lowest price of any in the United States.
</p>
<p>Contemplation of these facts, and upon the further
fact that lake engineers seemed to be about the best the
world had ever seen, led the lake capitalists to organize
the American Navigation Company, which built two large
cargo carriers, sent them down to salt water, and entered
the general cargo trade. Those vessels were among the
most economical ever built in the United States, all things
considered, <i>but they were unable to compete with the European
ship</i>.
</p>
<p>A story told by A. B. Wolvin to the Merchant Marine
Commission is significant here. A company of which
he was president operated a line of steamers from Duluth
and Chicago to Montreal and Quebec. The steamers
numbered ten of the maximum size for passage through
the Welland Canal&mdash;250 by 42 feet large, with a draft
of fourteen feet, and a carrying capacity of 2200 tons.
The cost of these ships, built under the best American
conditions of specialization, was $140,000 each, and the
operating expense was $135 a day each. While the company
was engaged in its work, a steamship man from

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
Sweden came and offered to put on twelve ships of the
same size, each at a charter price of $2900 per month.
His ships cost but $90,000 each, and the wages of crew
and other operating expenses were so much lower than
the American standard that he could make money at a
charter price of $1000 a month less than the cost of operating
the American ships. Having used these Swedish
ships long enough to know them (for it was necessary to
accept the offer to keep the Swede from starting in opposition),
Captain Wolvin testified:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"They are better from the standpoint of construction....
The vessels carry well; they run well. We have
no trouble with the crews."
</p>
<p>The crew of the Swedish ship numbered seventeen;
that of the American, twenty-two. And the Swedish wage
was far less.
</p>
<p>The bearing of these facts in any consideration of the
power of the ship-owners who are now in control of the
deep water traffic of the world is obvious.
</p>
<p>Other views of the world's carrying trade are of interest
here. The Hamburg-American Company runs steamships
in sixty-eight different lines. There is a line of its
ships from Europe to each port of importance from Montreal
to Newport News. It maintains other lines to the
important ports of the West Indies, to Ports Limon and
Colon on the narrow mainland, and to every important
port on the north, the east, and the west coasts of South
America. It reaches nearly every port of importance on

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
the coasts of Europe, and down the west coast of Africa.
Indeed, on the west coast of Africa the natives see two
German steamers to one under the British flag. It sends
other ships through the Suez Canal to skirt the coast of
Asia as far as Vladivostok; it maintains cargo gatherers
among the islands along shore, and then, from Japan, it
reaches across to Portland, Oregon, where it connects
with our Northern Pacific Railroad. It runs every kind
of ship from the 23-knot passenger packet to the economical
cargo carrier that uses perhaps little more than ten
tons of coal a day. The traffic of the world is, in a way,
within the touch of this one corporation. The worldwide
tides of commerce are felt and noted daily in the
home office, and while losses are suffered, here and there,
through depressions in business, <i>or through competition</i>,
the profit made by the vast fleet as a whole is sufficient
to yield regularly the modest dividends that satisfy the
owners.
</p>
<p>The fact that the powerful North German Lloyd is
allied with the Hamburg-American in all matters that
affect German commerce and trade is also a matter of
interest in this place.
</p>
<p>To show now how an effort to force a new company
into an established trade affects freight rates, it is necessary
only to refer to such an instance as the "war" that prevailed
in the trade from New York to South Africa in
1902. As Smith notes in <i>The Ocean Carrier</i>, the rival
steamships lost from $10,000 to $15,000 on every trip.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
Moreover, the low rates were of no advantage to commerce,
for commerce demands stability first of all. It is worth
noting, too, by the way, that in the course of this war,
goods were carried by English steamers from New York
to Africa for less than was charged by the same companies
on ships from London to the same destination.
</p>
<p>When American capitalists tried to establish a line of
ships from New York to Brazil some years ago, the venture
failed. One reason for this was the higher cost of American
ships and crews. Another was extravagance, especially
in providing terminal facilities at Rio de Janeiro. Old
merchants in Brazil still smile when they talk of what the
American line did in that way. But the most important
reason for failure was the advantage enjoyed by British
rivals in the triangular line route followed by their steamers.
In the currents of commerce on the Atlantic the British
manufacturer ships large quantities of goods to South
America, the South American producer ships large quantities
of coffee to the United States, and the American producer
ships large quantities of food-stuffs to Great Britain.
The British ships had profitable cargoes from home to Brazil.
At Rio de Janeiro and Santos they cut the rates far below
cost, and then on arrival in the United States they secured
cargoes for home at a profitable rate. The profits on
the two trips enabled them to endure the cut on the middle
passage. But because American manufacturers had little
to ship to Brazil the American ship lost money on both
passages.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
Every business man understands the advantages of
one who is well-established in any trade, over one who
is just beginning, but one method by which established
lines of ships hold their trade must have mention. The
merchant who sends all his goods by the established line
receives a rebate of 10 per cent on the amount of his
freight bill, the rebate being calculated once in six
months, say, and the payment being made six months
later. If the merchant ships an ounce of stuff by a rival
line he loses all the rebate, and he may be punished in
addition, if the rival is a new line. The merchant, having
rivals in trade, feels the loss of the rebate seriously; his
rivals by loyalty to the established line continue to enjoy
the rebate even when rates are cut below those of the new
line, and below cost. In such trades as that between
New York and Rio de Janeiro, where a number of lines
are plying, the established lines unite their entire resources
to kill off a new line trying to enter the trade.
</p>
<p>When the American people have before them any proposition
for the revival of the American merchant marine,
they should keep in mind that ships designed for the
purpose and at least in sufficient numbers, are afloat in
every trade of the world; that the freight rates are maintained
at a point where the profits are as low as any
afforded by any branch of the world's work; that the men
doing the work have been developed with the steam
carrying trade, just as the splendid American sailor of the
sail was developed by his environment, and they are therefore

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
at once well-informed, alert, enterprising, resourceful,
persistent, and merciless. Observe, too, that in the work
of the high seas man faces primeval conditions, brute force
prevails as nowhere else, and the fittest survives.
</p>
<p>Perhaps a definition of terms is needed here. By fitness
we mean the ability to do the world's work on the terms
which the world offers. We have learned to build bridges
and locomotives on those terms, but, in spite of the fact
that our ship-builders and ship-owners are fully protected
in the "home market," they have not yet learned how to
combine the locomotive and the bridge into a ship fit to
compete with the unsubsidized ships&mdash;the cargo carriers&mdash;now
in the world's traffic.
</p>
<p>In connection with the known degree of efficiency of
the world's merchant marine, as now afloat, consider
a statement that can be found on page 1248 of the <i>Report
of the Merchant Marine Commission</i>. It is, perhaps, the
most discouraging statement that has been made in connection
with our merchant marine.
</p>
<p>"The statistics of loss of ships at sea afford matter for
reflection.... They show, as the United States Commissioner
of Navigation has summarized them, that
out of every 100 American seagoing steamships over 100
tons, for the past seven years, on the average 2.24 have
been lost each year; that out of every 100 foreign seagoing
steamers over 100 tons, for the same period on the average
1.98 have been lost each year." (See also An. Rep. Com.
Nav., 1904, p. 19.)

</div>
<p>When American ships were supreme they were insured
at a less rate than those of any other nation, and the insurance
was placed, to a large extent, in England. Because
the American sailor of the sail, who had been
evolved by 200 years of American environment, was able
to handle his ship better than any other, he paid lower
premiums to the underwriters. But if this be true (and no
one disputes it), it follows that the higher percentage of
losses among modern American steamers proves that the
American environment, since the steamer era, has produced
a steamship sailor who is less efficient in his work
than our old-time sailor of the sail was in his, and less
efficient, too, than the foreign steamship sailor of the
present day. It is an important fact that a man may win
laurels upon the weather yard-arm in reefing topsails and
yet be of no particular value as an oiler or an assistant
engineer in the engine-room. At any rate, any effort
to revive the American merchant marine will have to be
made in the face of the record of American losses, and the
influence of that record upon insurance rates.
</p>
<p>Then in spite of the "boundless resources of our country,"
and "the intelligence of the masses," and a "protective
tariff" of twenty-five cents a bushel, the farmers of "the
overcrowded nations of Europe" are able to sell potatoes
in New York at a profit. And millions of dollars' worth
of factory goods made in Europe pay ocean freights, pay
the tariff tax, pay the commissions of agents, pay the
freight rates on our railroads, pay the margin of our retail

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
merchants, and are then sold at our doors in competition
with the products of our workmen.
</p>
<p>The fact that the tariff wall fails to keep out foreign
goods is a matter for serious attention in every point of
view, but it seems especially necessary here to consider
the influence of "protection," as it is called, upon those features
of American character which we call self-reliance
and the spirit of enterprise. Under the prevailing system
how is it possible for the American people to develop the
aggressive manhood that is needed?
</p>
<p>One other feature of the opposition that will be encountered
in any effort to create a new American merchant
marine is yet to be described&mdash;the support which the existing
carriers will receive from their governments during
the conflict; but before that is considered it may be well to
review the means by which it has been proposed to increase
our shipping.
</p>
<p>Naturally a people accustomed to "protection"&mdash;a
people who make boast of a system that is at best a confession
of a lack of ability to meet open competition&mdash;have
turned, first of all, to "government aid."
</p>
<p>Among the first provisions of Congress for the benefit of
American shipping after the adoption of the Constitution
was a 10 per cent discriminating duty on all goods imported
in foreign ships. It is asserted that this discriminating
duty supplied our ships with cargoes from foreign ports
to American, and was thus a feasible and satisfactory
"protection." A 10 per cent duty amounted then, and it

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
would amount now, to more than the whole freight, upon
some goods. It is also asserted that this discrimination
was made in order to "protect" our shipping. But in an
extended argument, which was made before the Merchant
Marine Commission (in the <i>Report</i> of which the curious
reader can find it), by Hon. E. T. Chamberlain, Commissioner
of Navigation, it was proved that "in the minds of
those that applied" it (Jefferson, Clay, Gallatin, John
Quincy Adams, etc.), the law was provided as a means of
retaliation only&mdash;for the purpose of preventing discrimination
against American shipping. The fact that our
government anxiously strove from the first to secure fair
reciprocity confirms this view. Further confirmation is
found in the fact that our old-time ship-owners were
unanimous in their support of the government in its efforts
to secure reciprocity.
</p>
<p>Those who advocate the policy of discrimination for
modern application assert that our shipping reached supremacy
at sea while the discriminating policy prevailed
as to Great Britain, and that is true, because the British
did not accept our offers of reciprocity until 1849. But
the assertion that our shipping became supreme <i>because</i> of
this policy is made only by those who are unable to appreciate
in full the facts of the case. For our ships that
were engaged in the trades between foreign countries,
beyond the reach of any "protection" afforded by "discrimination"
or any other artificial stimulation, at one
time measured a million tons. Why were those ships

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
favored beyond all others by the merchants who loaded
them? Why did merchants of rival nations&mdash;why did
the British merchants, for instance&mdash;charter these "Yankee"
ships, if it were not because they were the most efficient
in the world?
</p>
<p>It is a slander upon the American sailor of the sail to say
that he won the long pennant through coddling.
</p>
<p>As a system for modern adoption "discrimination" is
objectionable for three reasons. One is that it provides
at best for keeping our ships in trades between home and
foreign ports only; it does not provide for trade between
foreign ports. Next it is a system for supporting ships
that are confessedly inferior to those already in the trades&mdash;it
places a premium upon inefficiency. Last of all it is a
system that must excite all foreign governments to retaliation;
and that those governments will be eager to retaliate,
and that they will find ways enough for doing so, is beyond
doubt. In connection with this statement it is necessary
to keep in mind that we shall soon cease to export wheat in
any form, and the growth of population is so great that we
shall soon cease to export other, perhaps all other, food
products. Before inviting retaliation we must look ahead.
</p>
<p>Indirect discrimination has been proposed. Under this
the ships of any country were to be permitted to bring in
without discrimination goods produced under their flag; but
goods brought from any other country were to be subjected
to a discriminating tax. Any analysis of our imports,
however, shows that if British goods were taxed when

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
brought here in any but British ships, all such goods would
be forced into British ships at once, to the great advantage
of the British shipping. They could not at present, nor
for years to come, be forced into American cargo carriers.
As the system would in like manner help German shipping,
the policy would but make our task the harder.
</p>
<p>Before considering the policy of paying direct subsidies a
glance at the oft-repeated assertion that our shipping is
"our one unprotected industry" seems necessary. What
does "protection" provide for any industry, or what does
it pretend to provide? Simply the home market&mdash;this
and nothing more, at best. This is done by laying a tariff
upon imports. But the American shipping is now and always
has been protected that far&mdash;absolutely protected,
in fact, by prohibition. The importation of ships has been
forbidden, and the use of foreign ships in the "home
market" has been reserved to home-built ships for nearly
100 years. If "protection" could enable any industry
to expand from the "home market" to the foreign, then
the coasting trade industry should have expanded long
since over all the world. Unhappily, however, the profit
found in well-protected industries does but tend to make
the beneficiaries contented, and willing to let well enough
alone.
</p>
<p>Ever since the Civil War efforts have been made to induce
Congress to modify the navigation laws far enough to
enable Americans to buy ships in the cheapest market and
sail them under the flag. It is said that this would give

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
our shipyards so much employment in repairing the foreign
fleet so to be purchased that our builders would soon
learn how to set afloat ships as cheap as any in the world.
It is not easy to treat seriously one who supposes that repairing
tramps would develop the distinctive type of ship
able to produce results in ton-miles, which is imperatively
needed; but when it is remembered that free trade in ships
quickly drove the British from the sailing ship to the screw
steamer, the proposition looks attractive. For free trade&mdash;the
necessity of swimming unaided in rough water or
drowning&mdash;might compel the American builder to produce
the revolution-making ship for which we are to hope.
</p>
<p>We now come to the policy of paying direct bounties as a
means of creating a merchant marine; and nowhere are
candor and accuracy of statement more important.
</p>
<p>Bounties were paid in the colonial days. Virginia gave
a subsidy of tobacco to induce her people to build ships,
and they built one ship. When the whale fishery was depressed,
just after the Revolution, Massachusetts gave a
bounty on Massachusetts oil, with the result that the market
was flooded, and the fishery was depressed more than ever.
In spite of a bounty paid on oil by Rhode Island, her sailors
continued to favor the slave-trade. For some reason those
who favor subsidies as a means of reviving our shipping
never quote these facts.
</p>
<p>Of the effect of subsidies upon the Collins Line and of
other subsidies, something has already been said. The
first grant to the Cunard Company was made for military

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
and diplomatic purposes only, but when subsidized American
ships appeared, the Cunard grant was increased to
maintain the British flag in the trade. That is a fact beyond
dispute.
</p>
<p>It is manifest that the subsidy was of benefit to the
receiver. It helped the company to build improved ships.
It gave the builders some experience. It provided schools
for the instruction of seamen in the art of handling steamships.
The subsidizing of the Royal Mail, and of the lines
to other parts of the world, where private enterprise was
unequal to the occasion, created an increase of commerce
as well as some addition to the shipping of the country.
</p>
<p>With equal candor the evils of the system apparent in
those days ought to be told. The subsidized Cunarders
not only drove off the American subsidized lines but they
drove away the unsubsidized Great Western line. <i>They
depressed all British shipping that entered the trade to New
York and Boston.</i> If they had had a larger subsidy they
would have spread to Philadelphia, and thus would have prevented
or delayed the establishment of the Inman Line. The
British shipping in the trade to the northern ports of America
was not increased by the subsidy to the Cunard Company;
it was, on the contrary, restricted. Paying a subsidy to
establish a line where no steamers had traded before, and
none could trade without government aid, was a very different
thing from forcing a new line of steamers into trade
already supplied with shipping, and even congested. Paying
a fair price per pound to a ship for carrying the mail

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
ought not to be confused with paying a subsidy. The
first Cunard mail pay was not a subsidy; it was a low
price for the work done. Senator Rusk declared, in the
document already quoted, that the British Post Office
Department "derived a <i>clear</i> income of no less than
$5,280,800" from the contract in the first six years it was
in force. After Collins began running his ships by aid
of a subsidy the British subsidized Cunard to enable him
to compete.
</p>
<p>When the Collins Line reduced freights from £7 10<i>s</i>
to £4, <i>commerce</i> was certainly benefited, but the reduction
was ruinous to <i>shipping</i>. It was especially injurious to
the American packet lines. The advent of the subsidized
Collins Line did more to injure the American <i>shipping</i> of
its day than any other influence except that of the iron screw
steamer.
</p>
<p>Then the effect of admiralty supervision upon the subsidized
ships was an incubus upon progress. Naval men
are usually conservative, and conservatism often means
stupidity. Thus, after the British <i>Dreadnought</i> had demonstrated
the efficiency of the turbine engine our American
naval engineers provided one battleship with turbines
and another of the same model with reciprocating engines
in order to learn whether the turbine was worth installing
in future ships! The Cunard ships were built of
wood, long after iron was known to be a better material,
because of naval stupidity. Worse yet, when the requirements
of the merchant service became imperative

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
the rules of the admiralty were evaded&mdash;ships were reported
to be fit for war cruisers when in fact they were
useful as transports only.
</p>
<p>After the Civil War, Congress provided subsidies by
which a line from New York to Rio Janeiro, another from
San Francisco to China and Japan, and a third from San
Francisco to Hawaii, were established. Under these contracts
the policy did not have quite a fair trial. The beneficiaries
by activity in politics created so much opposition
that the subsidies were withdrawn before the effect was
fully apparent.
</p>
<p>By the Act of March 3, 1891, a subsidy was again provided
under the thin disguise of paying for carrying the
mail&mdash;a reprehensible plan, because if subsidies are justified,
they ought to be paid openly. The fact is that the
methods of indirection employed by the advocates of subsidy
have done much to discredit their system. Under this
act ships of 8000 tons and a speed of 20 knots receive $4 a
mile "by the shortest practicable route for each outward
voyage." Ships of 5000 tons and a speed of 16 knots
receive $2 a mile. Ships of 2500 tons and a speed of 14
knots receive $1 a mile, while those of 1500 tons and
a speed of 12 knots receive "two-thirds of a dollar a mile."
This act was designed to maintain lines of ships which
would be useful as scouts, transports, etc., in time of war.
</p>
<p>Before stating the effect of this law upon American shipping,
certain facts in connection with the subsidizing of
ships by the continental nations of Europe will be useful. It

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
is a curious fact that while the annual reports of our Commissioner
of Navigation have for years given much space
to the "progress" of the British, the German, and the
Japanese shipping, nothing has been said about the "progress"
of the shipping of France, of Italy, or Austria. The
progress of the shipping of England, Germany, and Japan
is stated because government aid is given to shipping in
those countries and shipping makes progress; but in the
other countries, where still more liberal aid is given to
shipping, no progress worth mention is made. The annual
report of the Commissioner of Navigation is made a
vehicle for the dissemination of arguments in favor of the
subsidy policy.
</p>
<p>A candid examination of the policy of Germany shows
that some aid has been given to lines of ships in the form
of liberal pay for carrying mails. The North German
Lloyd receives $1,330,420 per annum for its service to
China, Japan, Australia, and the German possessions in
the Pacific. The Germans thought it better policy to subsidize
a line of merchantmen than to maintain a line of
transports to its colonies as the United States has been
doing in connection with the Philippines. The payment
to the North German Lloyd is properly called a subsidy;
to give the name of subsidy to all payments made to
German steamers for carrying the mail is to misrepresent
the facts in a way that injures the cause of the subsidy
advocates materially in the eyes of all who know the
facts.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
The German railroads, which are owned by the government,
not only give low rates on goods intended for export,
but extremely low rates are provided for all materials
used in building ships. The fact that special rates on
railroads are used to promote the German merchant marine
is worth serious consideration in the United States,
even though such rates are here viewed with suspicion.
The national laws governing our railroads, as enforced
now (1910), are in some respects an incubus upon legitimate
and praiseworthy enterprise. Through ignorance
and prejudice the efforts of our transportation lines to
increase our export trade have been seriously hampered.
</p>
<p>Unquestionably subsidies and special rates were provided
to extend German influence by means of shipping.
The payment of bounties has been one feature of the expansion
of German shipping. To assert that the bounty
has been the sole, or even the chief, cause of that expansion,
however, is to misstate the facts. The experience of
France, for instance, shows conclusively that a subsidy in
itself is not enough to create a merchant marine. Although
the French subsidy is so liberal that French cargo
carriers are able to sail half-way around the world in ballast
to get a cargo at rates that would be less than cost of
maintenance for any other ship, the French merchant
marine grows so slowly as to justify the assertion, made by
the late Captain John Codman, that the French mariners
are working against a fiat of nature. The tonnage of 1881,

Further than that the German subsidies have been less
than those paid by the British (especially those paid to the
Cunard Company), and yet German steamers are steadily
encroaching upon those of the British. The reason for
the progress of German shipping is readily found in the
spirit and habits of the people. Consider the work of the
patient, spectacled scientist in his laboratory&mdash;his methods
and his aims; consider the growth of the factory system;
consider the effect of the training which all men receive in
the army or navy&mdash;how the whole people learn to move
as one man, and as comrades, for the attainment of a
worthy national object; consider how all the people&mdash;the
men with the hoe as well as the men behind the guns&mdash;are
stirred by an attack, or a seeming attack, upon the
Fatherland.
</p>
<p>The effect of government bounties upon German shipping
is like that seen when the spectacled German professor
of agriculture applies inorganic fertilizers to crops planted
in well-cultivated, humus-filled soils. The effect in France,
and other nations not well prepared for expansion, is like that
when those fertilizers are applied to arid, acid, uncultivated
land. In Germany the soil for the production of shipping
was in excellent condition before the fertilizer was applied.
What is the condition of that soil in the United States?
</p>
<p>The American subsidy law has been in operation since
1891. For the service rendered it provides more liberal
compensation than that given to any German ship. The
American Line (now operated as a part of the fleet of the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
International Mercantile Marine Company), owns two
American ships that were built for the line and two British
ships that were placed under the American flag by special
act of Congress. The subsidy maintains this line in existence
but does not increase it. The Mallory line has been
extended somewhat since the subsidy was given to it.
Elsewhere ships that were maintained under the subsidy
have been driven from their route by foreign competition.
The ships run in connection with the Great Northern Railroad,
for instance, were unable to compete with the Japanese
line between the same ports, partly because the Japanese
subsidy was more liberal, and partly because of the greater
expense of running American ships. In short, the law of
1891 has failed to provide an American merchant marine.
</p>
<p>Further measures for providing subsidies have therefore
been proposed. The Merchant Marine Commission,
after a lengthened inquiry, offered a bill to Congress which
was to provide a line from "a port of the Atlantic coast
of the United States to Brazil," with "ships of not less than
fourteen knots speed," at a subsidy rate of $150,000 a year,
"for a monthly service," or $300,000 for a fortnightly service.
A similar line to the River Plate was to receive
$187,500 and $350,000 according to the service. The
same subsidy was to be paid to a 12-knot line to South
Africa. Three lines from Gulf ports to Cuba, Brazil, and
Mexico were to be paid sums in proportion to the service
rendered, and three lines were to be provided for the Pacific
on similar terms.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
In addition to providing these lines an attempt was to be
made to set afloat cargo carriers by giving an annual bounty
of $5 a ton gross measurement to all cargo ships continuously
in service. On the whole ten new lines of ships
were to be established at an expense of $2,590,000, and it
was supposed that $10,000,000 might be the necessary
limit of the subsidy for the tramps. In the meantime it was
supposed that the existing lines working under the law of
1891 would continue in the service for the compensation
provided.
</p>
<p>Passing over the claptrap in the bill about the use of
these liners as scouts,&mdash;fancy a 16-knot merchantman
scouting around a squadron of Dreadnoughts!&mdash;the bill
ought to be considered on its merits because it sets forth
the amount of subsidy supposed to be sufficient to create
a real revival of our shipping, and thus gives an idea, perhaps,
of what sum would be adequate.
</p>
<p>Accepting the Commission's statement that the subsidies
would prove sufficient to place the more expensive
American ships upon an equality with the foreign, and "a
little more," as was said, it may be assumed that the new
lines would eventually employ sixty or seventy ships. At
$5 a ton the $10,000,000 might put afloat from 300 to 400
modern cargo carriers. Thus we should, at best, about
double our present registered fleet, which, in 1908, numbered
478 ships. But if we compare that fleet with the
German, which now numbers more than 2500 ships, or
with the British, which now numbers more than 4000,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
we shall see that even under the best circumstances we
should yet be a far cry from the supremacy of which we
made boast in other days. Indeed, the fleet of liners
would not number as many ships as the Standard Oil
Company now employs to carry abroad its products,
while the fleet of cargo carriers could not be compared,
with any satisfaction, to the fleet now in use by the allied
German companies of which mention has been made.
</p>
<p>And the ships thus to be set afloat, as they crossed the
seas, would proclaim to the world that they were in the carrying
trade, not by right of efficiency, but by grace of a subsidy.
</p>
<p>But now we are to consider whether any subsidy heretofore
proposed would really be sufficient to sustain either
liner or tramp. The effect of such ships upon freight
rates, for instance, was stated before the Merchant Marine
Commission, by B. N. Baker, formerly president of the
Atlantic Transport Company, and an advocate of the
subsidy system. He said:&mdash;
</p>
<p>"If you added any more to the open sea traffic (the foreign
traffic) of the United States than 100,000 tons a year
you would so demoralize the general carrying business in
rates, both as to freight and passengers, it would be so unprofitable
that no one could go into it, <i>unless you would
double, and triple that compensation</i>."
</p>
<p>The effect of that building programme upon the organized
mechanics of our shipyards&mdash;the strikes for higher
wages, and the consequent increase of prices&mdash;need only
be mentioned.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
Then figure up the expense of the war between the lines
from New York to South Africa in 1902, wherein ships lost
$15,000 in a single voyage. Manifestly the American
liners would need all of their subsidy ($15,625, per voyage)
to meet the reductions in freight rates which the opposition
would make. They would thus be no better off than they
would be if they were permitted to enter the trade on even
terms with the present lines&mdash;without war and without
subsidy. The line to Brazil would yet have to face the disadvantages
due to the triangular service which British
ships maintain, though the decreasing exports of American
food products would reduce those disadvantages somewhat.
</p>
<p>In short, one may well doubt whether the proposed subsidy
would enable our ships to overcome the opposition of
the powerful foreign interests that are already in the trade.
But if we suppose it to suffice that far, we have yet to inquire
what the governments behind those powerful corporations
would do. Recall the story of the Cunarders
<i>Mauretania</i> and <i>Lusitania</i>. The British government gave
those two ships to the company outright on the understanding
that it should operate and maintain them in a condition
fit to cross the Atlantic at a speed of 25 knots an
hour. This was done at the time that American capitalists
acquired control of a number of British lines, under the
name of the International Mercantile Marine Company,
and formed a working agreement with the two leading
German companies. This combination threatened British
supremacy on the North Atlantic, or was believed to

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
threaten it, and the whole British nation rose up to defend,
figuratively speaking. If that were possible under those
circumstances, it is certain that the "subventions" now
given to the British lines would be increased the moment
any American subsidized ships began to cut into the British
carrying trade. Increased subsidies would then be needed
by the American ships. If the American people were to
enter into a subsidy war it is likely that they could endure
the strain longer than any other nation; but is such a war
worth while to secure a part in a traffic that pays the well-subsidized
Cunard line no higher profit than 2.8 per cent a
year?
</p>

</p>
<p class="caption">By courtesy of the Cunard Steamship Company
</p>
</div>
<p>One more argument in favor of subsidy is yet to be
considered. With the Panama Canal and the Monroe
Doctrine to defend, it is necessary to provide sufficient
transports and colliers for the exigencies of war. The
spectacle of our splendid war fleet steaming around the
world with its fuel carried in ships under foreign flags,
was humiliating to the nation. Congress should build
auxiliaries more rapidly by direct appropriation, or it
should give ample subsidies, however great the sums needed,
to maintain auxiliary ships in the merchant service. Many
Americans would gladly pay their share of the tax for the
pleasure of seeing the American flag above a ship's taffrail,
now and then on salt water, in spite of the humiliation of the
fact that it was the tax and not efficiency that kept the flag
in place. A merchant fleet so provided would be a kind of
insurance against the exigencies of war, and even against

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
war itself. With a thousand American merchant ships
afloat on deep water there would be less danger of an aggressive
nation of Europe invading Rio Grande do Sul or
menacing the Panama Canal.
</p>
<p>Whether to provide the auxiliaries by direct appropriation
or by subsidy is, or should be, a question of
relative expense and efficiency. Such a question, one would
think, might be solved by the rules of arithmetic; at any
rate it is not necessary in the discussion to misrepresent
the attitude of senators from Southern States, nor to say
that the former American supremacy was due to "protection"
instead of the ability of the sailor of the sail.
</p>
<p>There are excellent and perhaps imperative diplomatic
and military reasons for maintaining at least one line of
swift steamers from the Pacific coast to the coast of Asia
and the Philippine Islands. The ships of this line, if
established, should be fitted, as battleships are, for a
cruising speed of say sixteen knots, with a reserve of power
for an emergency, when they should be able to develop real
scout speed&mdash;should be able to run away from the modern
twenty-one knot battleships. The value of a fleet of ships
of this kind, in a military point of view, and especially
upon the Pacific, is obvious. A dozen ships of the kind
would not be too many. A fleet of smaller ships, fit for
use as naval colliers, might well be maintained to gather
and distribute cargo along the Asiatic coast and among
the islands. We have undertaken the work of developing
civilization in the Far East, and we need to do everything

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
possible to prevent an attack upon our position there.
After squadrons of war-ships nothing will create a
higher respect for our flag among the people of that region
than a fleet of superior merchantmen <i>avowedly maintained
for diplomatic and military reasons</i>. In fact a
fleet so maintained would impress other peoples than those
of the Far East.
</p>
<p>The same argument may be made for the maintenance
of swift lines to both coasts of South America, where we
have the Monroe Doctrine and the Panama Canal to defend.
If we establish these lines, a war of subsidies is
to be expected, and the well-established and powerful
companies already in the trades will be wholly unscrupulous
in their opposition, not because their present profits are
high, but because they are low; a division of the traffic
will still further reduce the profits which are already too
narrow for comfort. We may be sure, too, that extravagance
and inefficiency of the Collins kind will be found in
the management of some of our companies; but as a diplomatic
and military measure the experiment seems to be
worth making. We have a very good precedent in the
action of Germany in establishing a line to its Pacific
possessions by a subsidy of a million a year, which is given
for the precise reasons urged herein. It will cost the United
States many times as much as it does Germany, but one
who looks at the matter broadly may well suppose that
such an increase of expenses, avowedly made as a measure
for increased military efficiency, might be worth while, in

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
the end, as a peace measure. For we shall be obliged in
any event, to go on increasing our naval budget to keep
even with the growth of European navies, until the war
burden becomes intolerable in Europe as well as in the
United States; and then we shall have measures for
preserving peace more rational than those now in vogue.
The sooner the burden is made intolerable the better.
</p>
<p>But while we can provide an ample fleet of naval auxiliaries
by means of subsidies, if we are willing to pay the
price, let no one suppose that such a measure will give the
country any share of the world's traffic worth consideration,
not to more than mention supremacy upon deep
water.
</p>
<p>One method by which the Merchant Marine Commission
thought to increase American sea power is memorable.
A heavy tonnage tax was to be laid upon all ships coming
from foreign countries to American ports, and the
money so raised was to be paid to American ships in the
foreign trade in return for carrying a certain proportion
of American citizens enrolled as members of a corps of
naval volunteers. The measure looked toward an increase
in the number of American seamen, but it did not
become a law.
</p>
<p>The communities that have supported nautical schools
(New York and Boston, for example) have had the end
in view for which the measure of the commission was
designed. Graduates of these schools are among the best
officers in our merchant marine, and this, too, in spite of

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
the fact that antiquated ships of the sail formerly served
as school rooms, and the boys were taught to handle the
obsolete marline-spike instead of the throttle. But, at best,
these efforts to turn ambitious young Americans from the
opportunities they find on land are inadequate. Congress
might have turned the naval academy into a splendid
nautical university for the education of all Americans who
wish to learn the ways of the sea. We appropriate millions
a year for the farmers, not as bounties on their products,
but to teach them, <i>through experiment stations</i>, how to do
their work. No one seems to have thought it worth while,
however, to make a national appropriation for the education
of merchant seamen.
</p>
<p>To confess the truth we have done nothing adequate to
the situation since the Civil War, nor has anything adequate
been attempted; but the people who have promoted the
work of our nautical schools have seen dimly what the whole
story of the American merchant marine proclaims. The
pretty pinnace <i>Virginia</i> thirty feet long, as she crossed and
recrossed the Atlantic; the <i>Trial</i> in the Azores and the
West Indies; the <i>Mount Vernon</i> as she dodged pirates,
privateers, and war fleets in her seventeen-day passage from
Salem to Gibraltar; the <i>Empress of China</i> in her venture
to the Far East; the sealers among the icy rocks of the
Antarctic; the whalers beyond Bering's Straits; the packets
of the sail as they crossed from New York to Liverpool;
and the clippers that flaunted the Stars and Stripes off
the weather beam of every ship they met on the Seven

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
Seas,&mdash;in short, the whole story of the American merchant
marine has been worth consideration here because it
sets forth unmistakably that the superior intrinsic efficiency
of the American sailor of the sail, during the contest that
culminated with the perfection of the ship of the sail, gave
supremacy to the American flag. We can buy ships&mdash;whole
fleets of them&mdash;if we are willing to pay the price,
and we can maintain them upon the high seas in like
manner; but we shall never again see the Stars and Stripes
triumphant upon the high seas until the American environment
evolves, once more, by natural process, the nautical
unit as efficient for the modern day as was our ship of
the sail in the days long past.

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
